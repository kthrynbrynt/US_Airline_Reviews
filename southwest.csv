Southwest Airlines,1,Daniel Cate,17th October 2017,"Verified Review | San Diego to El Paso. Southwest has officially lost all business and thousands of dollars a year from someone who used to be a loyal customer. My mother has been very sick and I had to fly back home to El Paso TX to be by her side. I’ve also had to push my flight back more than a few times cause I just can’t leave her in this state. The last change somehow changed my flight to the same day, same time. Instead of the next day. They were able to look it up but still unwilling to do anything about it. They said their no show policy states there has to be an attempt to cancel the flight. Why would someone first their flight to the same exact date and time. Next if you were sure that it was for the next day why would you attempt to cancel it. I am so dissatisfied with their customer service!","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,Jason Cuperus,14th October 2017,"Verified Review | My wife and I are travelling around the US for the first time from Australia. We were unsure of the local airlines and relied on mixed reviews. We flew Southwest from San Francisco to Orlando and Washington DC to New York and were amazed at the quality of service. The check in system is easy and efficient. the staff keep you posted at the departure gate on how to line up and how many people are on the flight. The system of no reserved seats appears daunting but somehow it works really well. Once on the plane the cleanliness was surprisingly good, the legroom was amazing as I am 6'5 and my wife 6' and the friendliness of the staff was as good as we have ever seen. Southwest Airlines will be my first choice for all future flights and I hope they maintain the high standards they currently have.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,7,T Balineska,1st October 2017,"Verified Review | Cancun to Baltimore. On a way home our flight was #1612 and I agree with customers who had not pleasant experience with flight attentents. We had a few coupons for free drinks and decided to use it on a way home because it was my husband birthday. I ordered Bloody Mary. My drink was amazing. I received a can of mix, packet of species and a bottle of vodka. I had over ice and had to add it to my plastic cup again to finish all liquid. My husband called a few times our flight attended to order more drinks for him. Then we heard unnecessary comment "" don't you think it's too much of jack Daniels?"" Maybe it was a joke but we paid for our drinks and it doesn't say how many drinks you can have. We are over 50 years old and I don't think those comments were appropriate. Our""neighbor heard about celebrating birthday and decided to join us with her friend. She also ordered Bloody Mary. For our surprise light attendant brought her plastic cup with ice and already premixed drink. We were schocked. This lady saw me having like total of 2 cups versus one that she got. What happened to other part of vodka and mix of Bloody Mary? Are you guys trying to get $5/drink and split it for 2 people? Not cool at all. Very cheap move. I like Southwest, never had problems but this incident ruined my opinion about that. Unfortunately it's only airline we have to use to get to Cancun and its very fast. I'll try to order my drink in a future just to check if you will improve but how unsanitary is to biting unopened drinks.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,C Pool,28th September 2017,"Verified Review | St Louis to Atlanta. I have been flying Southwest because they're cheap. The thing they upsell you on is boarding order. For my flight on 9/26 I purchased ""Business Select"" (and paid more for it) for flight 426 so I could get priority boarding. When it came time to board the gate agent allowed everyone to board in whatever order they wanted regardless of their boarding number. I had A-1 but because the gate agent said people could board in whatever order people pushed past me to board first. I asked the gate agent what was going on and why we're not boarding in order. He said to just get on the plane. Once on the plane I asked the lead flight attendant what was going on and she said the flight was light so just take a seat. I contacted Southwest's customer service web page and filled out a complaint. I got a response from a ""no-reply"" email saying sorry but that they would do anything including not refunding the cost for the business select boarding they didn't deliver. My opinion of Southwest Airlines is they're unethical to charge you for something and not deliver, and then not even care. Southwest is not just a shabby airline, they are in my opinion scam artists.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Southwest Airlines,1,Rebecca Walterbach,20th September 2017,Verified Review | New York to Dallas. Would not fly here again. They notified my hours before my flight by text message saying that they had cancelled my flight and didn't say why so I called and the gentleman said it was because of weather. So I tried rescheduling a flight since my brothers wedding was the next day but they didn't have anything left. So I was told to go to the airport which was 2 hours away and see if I could get on a flight but they just ignored me and said the fastest they could get me out was Monday and the wedding was Saturday. They were super rude and didn't care what happened to me after I stood there 2 hours to talk to someone. I ended up having to spend $500 on a flight out instead of the $150 flight I had booked months ago. It was horrible I have never been through something so stressful in my life.,"Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,2,Shannon Mills,20th September 2017,"Verified Review | Seattle to Milwaukee via St. Louis. The flight itself was okay, but the flight was delayed on both my trip out and my trip back home. Very little info was shared about why and the delay out of St. Louis back to Seattle was extensive due to staffing issues. Unacceptable. You should not have to call in staff last minute. We had to wait for staff twice because the first back-up never showed. It seems every time I fly with this airline, there is a delay. I don't have this problem with other airlines and I don't know that I will fly Southwest again.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,Nick Paige,16th September 2017,"Verified Review | Chicago Midway to Phoenix. I set up a vacation for my wife to go see her best friend in Arizona, this is her first time flying. Her flight was scheduled to leave from Midway airport In Chicago at 11:15am. We got there a couple hours early, got through checkout and thought we were good to go! 40 minutes before she's supposed to board, the flight got delayed and was now scheduled to leave at 1:35pm. We left to get some food and was back at the gate by 12:45. They then delay the flight to 2:35. Then just minutes later they cancel the flight! Went to the counter to ask what to do. They told us as long as the ticket had today's date we can go to terminal B17 and catch that flight. So we go to B17 and they informed us that was wrong and that they were ""probably just trying to get us through the line"". We then had to go stand in a different line, which we waited in that line for an hour and a half and in that time only went half way. I finally go up to the terminal attendant to ask him what we can do. He again said we need to wait in that line in hopes of being put on standby. Luckily a pilot overheard him and asked me what was going on. So I explained the story and he kindly went behind the desk and told them to change her over to that flight! I thought we were home free, but I was mistaken. He told her that instead of being a direct flight like the original flight I booked her, there would be a layover in Oakland. He said she wouldn't have to leave the plane when they go there. She called me in Oakland saying they forced her off the plane and since the pilot had the ticket she didn't have a ticket to show the attendant who was rude. So she got off the plane and tried explaining to the attendant what happened. The attendant told her ""to bad cause you don't have a ticket"". My wife went up to the counter panicking. The woman made a few calls and almost an hour later was able to get her on the flight to Phoenix. In Phoenix she was supposed to be picking up a rental car from Advantage (I purchased everything through southwest.com) and when I called to verify the car they said there wasn't a reservation. When I called to ask Southwest, they said they don't rent through Advantage. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they confirmed they do in fact rent through Advantage. Something apparently happened in processing the rental car so now her friend has to drive to Phoenix to pick her up. This was the absolute worst experience with Southwest.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,5,Britney Rocha,13th September 2017,"Verified Review | Chicago to Providence. I am not a fan of Southwest airlines. Even though they offer a lot of freebies. The seating is open seating. There is no way to actually pick a seat. When you purchase your ticket you are given A,B or C and you just board when your info is called, but you cannot choose which one you want when booking your ticket. It is terrible. I will not fly Southwest again. I was traveling with my spouse and we couldn't even sit together. Everyone who boarded ahead of us took window and aisle seat.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,E Kosko,11th September 2017,"Verified Review | Montego Bay to Baltimore. Southwest was always my preferred airline. However after this experience I am appalled by the way this situation was handled. An air traffic control tower was struck by lightning on 9/8/2017 in Jamaica. We were suppose to leave on 9/9/2017. Obviously this wasn't an option, completely understandable. But the tower was fixed late night on 9/9/2017. As we talk to others that were forced to stay at the resort ($450 a night) with us their airlines Delta, American, United, etc. were understanding and scheduled extra flights to help out and get them home to their families. But Southwests' answer to us is to bad we aren't sending extra flights forcing us to spend an extra $2000+ on a room and missing out on being paid at work. Southwests' answer is you're staying until Wednesday 9/13/2017. I guess I had the wrong assumption of this airline and stand corrected. Way to go Southwest (as sarcastic as I can be here) you've ruined this trip for my family.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,9,W Lawner,4th September 2017,"Verified Review | Chicago to Las Vegas. Our row was completely missed to get drink order. When the flight attendant came around to drop drinks/snacks off to other rows we asked for a drink. We got an eye roll from the flight attendant after our entire row was completely awake yet again missed in the drink order. The gentleman aside from myself and my boy friend as rudely spoken to accusing him of being asleep which he was not. My boy friend also got a drink and while the attendant did seem preoccupied with attending to other guests on the flight my boy friend gently reminded him we ordered drinks, which was followed by a rude comment and loud embarrassing response from the attendant on just how may people were on the flight and we had to wait. We would have not had said anything if he didn't seem completely dismissive with our request. I understand they are busy but the attendant's responsive was just rude. This was my first trip with southwestern and the flight started off fantastic with the attendant making jokes and my previous flight before the lay over was seamless and fantastic. This absolutely ruined my experience with Southwestern on how rude the attendant was.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,Madeline Garza,26th August 2017,"Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Albuquerque. Extremely upset with the service of Southwest. I am a freelance makeup artist and have to fly sometimes for jobs. Have never had a problem with Southwest until now. I check my makeup kit due to the fact I have a lot of liquids and can't have it as a carry on. I had them put a fragile sticker on just as a precaution because I packed it well and it should have been fine. I opened my kit once I get on site for my job and everything is shattered. I was reassured by numerous Southwest incident associates that since the damage was extensive and puts me out of a job I should be reimbursed. Going through months of trying to get my case looked at and have to deny jobs due to the fact my equipment is ruined they finally got back to me. ""Unfortunately we will not be reimbursing you because we are not liable. Here's a voucher for your next flight"" Thanks for putting me out hundred of dollars, putting me out of a job, oh!

Southwest Airlines,4,A Wright,18th August 2017,"Verified Review | This is the second time in as many months that I have tried to fly Southwest from Burbank to Salt Lake City. Both flights were delayed a significant amount of time and no notice until 30 minutes before scheduled departure. I asked an agent if it would be okay to leave so that I didn't have to sit in the airport for 2.5 hours. He said he wouldn't advise it because the departure time can change again. When I asked if any of the times they put up mean anything he said ""yes!"" Obviously didn't get my sarcasm. When I asked why my flights keep getting delayed his only response was ""it's the nature of the business."" If that is the case, why do we have departure times at all? If this had been a one time scenario I could understand, but this seems to be happening more and more. Do not trust this airline to fly on time more than about 20% of their flights. That seems to be my average.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,2,J Pheeny,18th August 2017,"Verified Review | Atlanta to Dallas Love Field. Our frustrating and unexpectantly expensive situation with Southwest Airlines began on Sunday August 6th 2017 after having spent a wonderful weekend in Georgia at Ft. Benning to celebrate our son’s graduation from Boot Camp. Our group consisted of our son’s 3 parents and 1 elderly grandmother who needs physical assistance getting around. Ready to head to the Atlanta airport to catch our flight (2419) back to Dallas Love Field, we received an elctronic message stating that our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms over Dallas. We called home (Dallas) to check with our house sitter and other friends to hear what the weather was like. They said there were no storms at all. It was clear skies and very hot. I checked my weather app and saw no storms in the DFW area. We called Southwest customer service who said we could spend the night in a hotel in Atlanta and catch a flight to Dallas the next morning. But we needed to get back to work the next morning (a Monday). We asked for reimbursement for the 4 tickets we will need to by from other airlines. SWA Rep said we would need to call Customer Relations. But a refund is not possible since the cancellation was due to weather! When we arrived at the Atlanta airport we ran to the American Airlines ticket window and bought the last 2 AA tickets flying to DFW that evening for $536.40! AA ticket counter rep told us all flights to Dallas and DFW airports were flying with no weather issues. So we let our son’s mother and elderly grandmother have these 2 tickets since we were not sure there would be any other available flights out that night. Then we ran to the other end of the terminal to the Delta ticket counter. We bought 2 tickets to DFW for $654.32! Delta also confirmed no weather issues flying into the DFW area. The total for 4 tickets including terminal fees cost us $1,217.72! I called SWA Customer Relations the next day to inquire about a refund for the 4 tickets we had to purchase due to the SWA cancellation. We spoke to SWA Customer Relations rep at the corporate office in Dallas TX. He said no refund is given when a cancellation is made due to weather. He said the FAA said there were thunderstorms over Dallas. I shared that I called friends in various locations in Dallas and NO ONE saw a single could in the sky. I shared that ALL other airlines were flying from Atlanta to Dallas that afternoon and evening with no knowledge of storms in Dallas. SWA refused to offer even partial compensation. He said talking to anyone above him would be wasting my time and would not transfer me to a supervisor. I hung up. It was obvious SWA was not going to acknowledge they made a mistake cancelling our flight or even apologize for causing such unnecessary stress and expense costing us over $1,200.00 in additional ticket fees.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,Meschelle Jensen,7th August 2017,"Verified Review | We had an awful experience traveling from Ft. Lauderdale to Albuquerque on Southwest Airlines yesterday. First let me say that SWA has always been our airline of choice, but yesterday we experienced terrible customer service, and I do not know if we will ever fly with them again. At the Ft. Lauderdale airport our flight was delayed by an hour and a half. We asked to re-rout the remainder of our flights, but we were assured that we had plenty of time to make all of our flights, so we had no need to re-rout. Our flight touched down in Nashville to allow more passengers to board the plane, the flight was then held on the ground to allow passengers that had been re-routed time to board the plane so that they could make connecting flights. We asked for help from the flight attendants, but were told it was out of their hands. When the flight landed in Denver we had fifteen minutes to catch our connecting flight, but the pilot announced that we could not get a gate, so we were held on the tarmac until after our flight left. At this point we went to the gate to ask for help and were told that we were held in Nashville so that many more people could make connecting flights, it was a business decision to hold us up so that more people could make their flights. We were told that we had been rebooked on the first flight out the next morning at 6:50 am (it was 10:00 at this time). I asked to speak to a supervisor because we now had to spend an unplanned night in Denver ""so that more people could make connecting flights, a business decision."" The same supervisor refused to give us a hotel voucher stating that he had already given away all vouchers for the day, but offered us a worthless coupon for a ""discount"" on a Best Western hotel room ($157-unsure when he could have a shuttle pick us up) or a no name hotel for $69 no shuttle. We ended up spending $234 at the Westin on the airport property since we had to be back at the airport for our flight in 6.5 hours by the time all of this transpired. The next day when we got home and claimed our luggage, it was wet, with the clothes inside soaked. In my opinion, if an airline makes ""a business decision"" to inconvenience one set of passengers to accommodate another set of passengers, they are at least obligated to pay for the hotel room of the stranded passengers.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,Rachael Bragg,5th August 2017,Verified Review | Northwest Florida Beaches to Nashville. I'm delayed at PCB airport with a baby and have made multiple attempts to get released from this flight and rebooked so I can get my daughter to a hotel and in the bed. We left the upstairs area where we were boarding without knowing we couldn't get back through and although I've spoken to several people here who work for SWA everyone here is telling me they can't help me and I'll have to keep waiting. I've also called the customer service number to attempt to make the changes that way and they to aren't assisting me. All I need to do is rebook a flight for tomorrow and no one has shown any interest in helping me despite the fact that I have a very exhausted and upset child who needs to be in the bed. This has been by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had with an airline and will definitely cause me to reconsider ever booking another SWA flight.

Southwest Airlines,9,C Martin,24th July 2017,"Verified Review | First time flying this airline (RDU-MCO-RDU), and I have to say I'm impressed with the service overall. It's no frills, but the customer service is excellent and two free checked bags is even better. I know some people like to badmouth EarlyBird Check In, but I bought it a few days before my flight and got A60 on both trips. Both were full flights and on time, while the return flight was eight minutes early. Considering late afternoon flights from Orlando tend to get delayed due to late afternoon storms, that was a nice change. The captain on both flights kept us informed of any developments and whenever we hit bumpy spots. Only negative things about my flight were the worn seats and the flat Coke I was given. A fairly uneventful flight, which is how I like it. Highly recommend Southwest Airlines.","Aircraft Boeing 737-300

Southwest Airlines,5,Connie Custin,20th July 2017,"Verified Review | We flew from Atlanta to St. Louis on July 12 with Southwest. We left Atlanta an hour late because the plane was held up for late arriving passengers. Didn't know any airline would inconvenience a plane full of customers who selected a departure time only to be ignored. What could we do? Southwest had us on the plane so we were captive to their whim. Now after an exhausting week, again we are delayed an hour (could be more) leaving St. Louis to return to Atlanta. The most insulting thing about this delay is that there has been a plane at the gate since well before regularly scheduled departure time but zero activity. Zero explanation from SW. I guess they think we don't deserve that courtesy. I'm disappointed, aggravated and wondering why I keep putting myself through this with SW. Beware, time obviously means nothing.

Much to my surprise, I had to go through TSA security again because you walked from a secure area to a non-secure area. Even though I purchased a bottle of water in a secure area at the originating gate - I had to toss it because of the 2nd TSA security screen. On the way back - I had purchased a few items from the gift shops while waiting for my flight. Unfortunately, I had to change gates in San Diego - and had to go through the 2nd TSA security screen again. During this screen, I was told I could not keep a bottle of jelly I had purchased in the gift shop (receipt still in the bag) because it was over the limit - how incredibly ridiculous is that? I wasn't leaving the area without my purchased jelly - I didn't break any rules and I was going to be penalized due to SWA sending passengers on connecting flights through those gates. At one point I was told to just go back and get my luggage and place the jelly in my luggage - seriously? I just got off a plane and am in the process of going to a gate for my connecting flight - how on earth am I supposed to go get my bag? After speaking to the TSA supervisor and making it very clear I was not leaving without my jelly - the TSA agent decided they would test the jelly for whatever they test liquids for and then wrapped it up and handed it back to me after it passed the test. I can't be the first passenger this has happened to and the TSA agents explained they had made SWA aware of this issue but nothing had been done. For goodness sake SWA, use a little common sense and fix this issue. Have passengers who have to use those gates for connecting flights enter a separate area divided by security glass or stop routing passengers to those gates if they are changing gates for connecting flights. The current situation is beyond frustrating and really is inexcusable - there has to be a simple fix and if it isn't a simple fix - you should still fix it because it is a huge issue for your customers. For now - traveler beware - if you are changing gates during travel - avoid the San Diego airport because if your connecting flight is through gates 1, 1A or 2 - you can kiss that water or any gifts you just purchased in the secure area of your last flight that are liquid good-bye.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,T Ranton,15th July 2017,"Verified Review | Hartford to Orlando. I will never fly Southwest again, they do not care at all about customers. My flight was cancelled only 4 hours before it was scheduled leave. When I called to see why it was cancelled they said they had no idea. I was flying down to visit family for only 3 days, and I took off work. They changed my flight to a 5am trip so now I had to wake up at 2am to get to the airport. When I called Southwest they said that they couldn't do anything for me that it was not their fault or their responsibility. I wasn't asking for my money back I just wanted some type of compensation for my inconvenience.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

I checked in what I thought was quickly and ended up in group c. Why don't they have assigned seating? Got another awful seat like I always do. I only had 1 bag but it was overweight so I was charged $75. So if I had 2 bags I would not have been? What is that about. Third bad experience with this airline.

Southwest Airlines,8,A Richards,28th June 2017,"Verified Review | Since 1999, I have flown Southwest and never had problems with it. They have decent seats, and the staff has been friendly and helpful. In addition, Southwest prices are generally fair that customer can purchase tickets in advance for cheaper than most other carriers. They have added some decent flights which were beneficial to our whereabouts. Their boarding process, although different, works well. Fort Lauderdale Airport's Concourse B requires more expansion of rooms and gates because I see the heavy crowd, which makes me uncomfortable to walk. Sometimes chairs are full; you have to stand up, waiting to board. There are few plugs to charge devices. Tampa Airport's Concourse C looks very neat and comfortable. There are many plugs to charge devices. Thus, I have heard Southwest has 101 destinations in the United States and 8 additional countries that its airline connections are expanding. I have been flying often B737, which is great planes with good seats, and I hope Southwest buy more new next generation Boeing planes with more room for legs. Lastly, Southwest Airlines offers internet service using a satellite-based Wi-Fi provider. Cost per device for Wi-Fi access is $8. I know Wi-Fi is not free, and I wish Southwest offer us for 100% free Wi-Fi in order to contact with families and/or friends and watch streaming movies or shows. Therefore, I'm glad that I have decided to fly this airline without a doubt.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Southwest Airlines,1,Sarah Markland,17th June 2017,"Verified Review | It was the worst flight I've ever taken. Flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Islip, NY. They delayed us an hour due to weather, 2 hours due to air traffic control, and then 5 hours because the pilot's hours to fly had expired and they needed to find another crew. Found a crew and then the crew cancelled at 2am. They then made me wait in a line for 3 hours to change my flight. I was in the airport for 12 hours straight and all they provided me was a mini bag of mini pretzels and 6oz water. They refused a hotel, transportation and food after keeping us in an airport for 12 hours just to cancel the flight. They expected me to travel for 24 hours straight starting at 6am. Meaning they wanted me to stay up for 48 hours straight. I get on the flight for 24 hours later, a direct flight and they delayed my 6.20pm flight until 10.45pm. I had to reschedule my flight for the following day yet again and they weren't willing to provide hotel, transportation or food once again. So my flight was initially 6.30pm from Fort Lauderdale and we were supposed to land at 9.20pm in Islip. We were given an hour delay due to weather (7.30pm-10.30pm). After the delay, we boarded the plane (7.00pm). They then proceeded to keep us on the plane for over an hour as directed by federal air traffic control (8.00pm). Then they made us sit another hour on the plane demanding that we all stay in our seats and stay buckled because they expected to depart soon (9pm). After this hour, the pilot comes on the PA system and told us that he's reached the maximum number of consecutive hours that the pilot policies allow (9.30). They took us back to the gate where we were given no updates or information for at least 2 hours (11.30). After this, they told us that they were trying to find a pilot and crew to fly the plane. They then told us that our flight would board at 12.50am. They delayed us twice more until they cancelled my flight at approximately 2am. They automatically rebooked me for a flight that would board at 8.30am in Fort Lauderdale and would bring me to Tampa. They would then give me a 10 hour layover in Tampa. I would board the 10.30pm flight to Islip and get back at approximately 1.30am. I waited in a line 3 hours to get this changed and also demanded a hotel, transportation, and food (5am). They hadn't fed us anything but a mini sized bag of mini pretzels and 6oz of water in 13 hours. They refused a hotel. They refused transportation. They refused food. They also told me that they could not change this horrible flight. I went back to them twice and harassed them before they finally put me on a flight that boarded exactly 24 hours from the one I originally had. The woman was extremely snotty and rude to me the entire time. I had to call my friend at 5 in the morning after she, her parents and my parents stayed up the entire night. My friend picked me up at 5.45am because Southwest wouldn't even provide me with a taxi.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,3,M Samina,5th June 2017,"Verified Review | I have flown Southwest in the past and never had problems with it. However, this last trip was very upsetting due to the very rude customer service. We had a flight from Chicago to Dallas and then to El Paso which is home for us. From Chicago to Dallas as we started approaching Dallas the weather conditions became difficult and we knew we were going to have delays. It took an hour to land and I completely understand and would never complain about the fact that there are delays due to weather and also due to keeping us safe. Once we landed our next flight was delayed for about an hour. So we hung around and waited. Then it got delayed for another half hour, 45 minutes, then delayed for 15 more minutes, etc. The delays kept coming, then finally they said we were going to board. So they told us they would be ready to board but they couldn't find a pilot. This was at around 11:30 pm. So they kept saying a pilot was on his way and any minute now we will board. Around 1 am I get a notification that the flight has been cancelled. I wish it could have gotten cancelled earlier so we could make accommodations as to where to sleep. I don't understand how you don't have a pilot. And if that's the case, then please just tell us with time so we can make accommodations. People started running to Southwest counters and we were notified that only 2 counters were open. They said you can call and rebook or wait in line at the counter. I called as I waited in line and they told me they could not assist me over the phone because I had a bag checked in. When the counters opened everybody ran to the counter and I had to pick up my 5 year old who was asleep on the floor so by the time I got to the counter I was toward the end of the line. I stood in line until about 3:45 am. When it was finally my turn, the staff was extremely rude. They treated us like we should be grateful they were even lifting a finger for us. The first lady I talked to was Chinese and had broken English. As soon as I walked up she rolled her eyes at me. Before I even spoke. I felt contempt seeing as I was the one who had been standing in line close to 4 hours. But I am a nice person so I decided to smile and be polite anyway. I asked her to please rebook my flight as early as possible and she gave me 2 options: one for 7 am departure connecting at Austin which was already delayed or one for 7 pm direct flight. I told her I was skeptical about the 7 am one since it was already delayed but 7 pm is such a long time to wait when you don't have anywhere to sleep or shower and my luggage is checked in. She gave me a look of not my problem tapped her fingers on the counter and told me to pick one. I asked her if they could help accommodate us so we could sleep somewhere and at this she became very angry and told me ""we aren't going to give you anything!"" She treated me like I was trying to get some ""advantage"" of the situation. I just wanted a place to sleep, and if there's nothing to be done there is a way to state things politely. I told her I needed to think it over and I would come back but really I wanted to not be taken care of by her. I went back in line and got another representative. He was a little bit nicer but he also kept chatting to the guy next to him for long periods of time as if I wasn't there. Maybe the system was reloading or maybe he was just ignoring me. I saw a lot of people crying and I don't blame them. We slept at the airport until boarding time.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,3,Andrea Hunter,30th May 2017,Verified Review | Baltimore to Providence. Dissatisfied with Southwest's customer service policy. Flying today from Baltimore to Providence. Circumstances changed and trying to fly standby on an earlier flight home we were told it would be an additional $125 on a $60 flight. Watched the plane take off only half full. Would have cost them nothing to put us on that plane instead of spending 3 hours in the airport. I am a SW Rapid Rewards credit card holder and would have expected better customer service from a company that prides itself on no additional fees being their difference. Will definitely choose to use my travel cards that allow flexible flying on different airlines in the future.,"Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,4,Joel Yesley,25th May 2017,"Verified Review | Washington to Providence. This was the first time I had flown Southwest in several years, never having had a problem in the past. This time was different! The departure flight was delayed 1.5 hours because of a ""plane switch"" related to a mechanical problem. While this was mildly annoying, I did not complain to any staff personnel. The delay on my return flight 2 days later was twice as long--3 hours--and for the same reason. By then, my patience was exhausted, so I asked for more information from the gate attendant. She informed me that our particular scheduled aircraft had not experienced any problem but instead had been rerouted to the west coast from Chicago to replace a plane that had been delayed for several hours while undergoing repairs, in other words, another ""plane switch."" That plane was instead used to ferry us to Wash., DC. Had repairs taken longer, we would have been stuck even longer in Providence, unless Southwest had decided to spread the misery even more. Southwest offered no alternative flights on other airlines nor did they offer a voucher as compensation for the delay. If their planes are so unreliable, perhaps they need to establish sharing arrangements with other airlines or keep planes in reserve for such occasions. Ground personnel were courteous but were apparently unable to offer any practical assistance or compensation for the inconvenience.","Aircraft Boeing 737-800

I had heard that they were excellent and after my horrendous experience with AA at the beginning of my trip, I decided to switch my return flight to Southwest Airlines. Everyone from the lady at the check in counter to the flight attendants were amazing. The seats were comfortable, good IFE. The flight attendant from Phoenix to Denver was the best I have ever had on a flight and I fly several times a year. My only complaint was that my baggage was put on the wrong flight out of Phoenix into Denver but the lady at baggage claim was so kind and helpful in making sure that my baggage got back to me quickly.

Southwest Airlines,3,Kayla Lopez,3rd May 2017,"Verified Review | Orlando to Boston via Nashville. I am very upset with the service of this airline. I have never had a problem with Southwest Airlines prior to this trip. On the way down from Boston, the plan was switched twice due to mechanical issues. Needless to say we were stuck in Logan for an additional four hours. They thought that a $100 per voucher per ticket would be okay. Absolutely wrong. We missed our connecting flight and had issues with our car rental because we were late. On our return flight, we had felt with a rude desk staff at gate 121/122. I had asked if we could use the family boarding due to the fact that one of my brothers had a fear of flying and the other, it was his second time flying. They are 17 and 13. She said nope, he's not 6 and I am not allowing it, the standards are enforced here. I told her the southwest personnel in Boston and in Baltimore understood our situation and allowed us to board with families. She said she was not allowing it what so ever. I asked for a manager she said no one was around. I then proceeded to ask for the customer care line to where she gave me a card with minimal information on it. I had to ask a second time for the number. I am very displeased with the entire trip with flying with Southwest Airlines and I will reconsider flying with them again.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,2,L Remmel,29th April 2017,"Verified Review | Midway-Chicago to Tampa, with Southwest Airlines. My husband and I haven't flown in years. Staff were friendly, but not so helpful. The boarding process was fine, until we actually got to the plane. We were unaware that there is not assigned seating. We had to separate, him in front me in back. I was very upset about this as I was already nervous about the flight to begin with. Now I had to sit with strangers. We were one of the last to board and it was obvious we were together (tickets purchased together). Not one staff member tried to help and see if they could get us seats together. The icing on the cake was the horrible uncomfortable flight between two larger men. At this point I had fully decided, we would not fly Southwest again. Fortunately this flight was only 2.5hrs. Their flights are cheap, but I will pay the extra to a different airline to be comfortable, and to sit with the people I am flying with. I did notice that they let families flying with children board first which is great! I have two children that I would want with me too, had they been traveling with us. One suggestion though, maybe couples be allowed to board after that then singles could fill in the empty seats. Or just have assigned seating.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,S Lewis,19th April 2017,"Verified Review | Orange County to Louisville. When boarding my plane, Southwest Airlines requested volunteers for being bumped onto another flight, I was second in line to offer up my seat for $300. Halfway getting onto the plane (I was in the B boarding group), they called me off of the plane. Ten people had to climb over my suitcase while I got off the airplane, and I was told after getting off that they didn't need me to volunteer anymore. Angrily, I re-boarded the plane and was the last person to get on, and had to sit in the only seat available in the very back of the plane. When I got to my connecting flight, I was supposed to stay on the airplane and go to the next city. Upon landing, I was told to get off the airplane and would be moved to another plane at a different gate. This gate and plane change was not the only inconvenience, the plane would now be delayed by 2.5 hours! This would put me in at 01:40am! My husband has to work in the morning and we live nearly an hour away from the airport, so he has to come get me in the middle of the night. My original arrival time would have been at 22.50 or (10.50 pm). The ticket lady told me that the pilot forgot his passport in Cancun? I'm not sure what that has to do with why the plane was over two hours late. This infuriated me. I am a frequent customer with this airline because of their cheap fares. I get you get what you pay for. I can't say I will be flying with them again, unless I'm desperate for a cheap flight.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Got a later flight non-stop, booked to take off at 8:45 but my flight was delayed 3 times and by the 3rd time it was because the pilot had too many flying hours. They didn't have a back up pilot until roughly 20min after the plane has landed, that backup pilot was in St. Louis. So on my non-stop flight we had to make a stop.

Southwest Airlines,1,H Brettell,8th April 2017,"Verified Review | Chicago to Ft Lauderdale. What the heck happened to Southwest? Customer service is awful. No customer support anymore. Been having issues with them lately. Today was the last straw. Overbooked my flight- wouldn't let me or my husband on. No seats available, although the desk agent said we made the cut and would get on the plane. (This was after a 2 hour delay). Couldn't get us to our destination until a day and a half. For a 3 day getaway, nope. Vacation was cancelled. And when dealing with them after- they don't care one bit. Just want your money. What a shame of a company Southwest has turned into. Take note Southwest, or you are going to be losing customers. (You've lost us). I'm not the only one noticing this decline as of late.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,Jonathan Boston,29th March 2017,"Verified Review | Portland to Austin. My complaint is the decline in Southwest Airlines customer service. I'd been a raving fan for decades about SW, now I'm done. The straw that broke the camel's back was me booking travel for my wife to meet me in DC for Spring break. I booked the ticket in January for travel March 28th. When I left four days earlier for DC neither my wife or I received her confirmation, so Saturday I call Southwest. The ticketing agent was great about helping us find my wife's confirmation, she informed me I accidently made it for the 21st not the 28th, and that they recorded it as a no-show. She said usually you forfeit the funds, but in this case purchase a replacement short notice replacement for the date you wanted, the 28th, then M-F call our customer relations team and they will allow you to use the prior dollars spent as a credit for 12 months against future travel. Well today the 28th from my tradeshow I waited over 20 minutes until the agent answered the phone, at 9:15am. She was very terse with me and said it didn't matter what the ticketing agent told me Saturday, that I did have to forfeit the few hundred dollars I spent on the prior ticket I did not use. I said even though I was instructed differently by a colleague of hers? She said yes, and that I cannot be connected to a supervisor as she is the only supervisor.","Type Of Traveller Business

Southwest Airlines,1,D Sarren,27th March 2017,"Verified Review | Detroit to Atlanta. The entire trip was terrible. The check in people were mean and not understanding in anyway. The airplane system was terribly unorganized and everyone we had to talk to was horrible, besides one lady. We missed our first flight because the check in kiosk wasted our time. We eventually made it to Atlanta. The flight back was mainly the same story, except I ran ahead of my mother and made it to the gate. I told them we were here and that my mother was on her way. The man hadn't closed the door and started telling me he didn't want to and he had paperwork to finish before they could fly. My mother came not a minute later and the door was shut after she arrived. The entire experience has made me hate this airline and air travel in general. I would never recomend it to anyone else looking to fly.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

The whole thing was disorganized and you couldn't hear a thing over the speakers. I'm in the military so I'm accustomed to getting called for priority boarding. I went up to the lady when we started boarding and asked her if they called military personnel up yet and she said only if I was in uniform. I've always just shown my ID and then she said ok I'll get to you in a second. She proceeded to let everyone in the first line pass by me while I stood there with my ticket while she just kept looking up at me seeing how embarrassed I was until the last person in the first line went by and then just took my ticket without a single word.

Southwest Airlines,10,David Bergstrom,11th March 2017,"Unverified | Austin to New Orleans. I usually stick with full service carriers, but occasionally fly Southwest on routes where they provide a nonstop routing, such as this. Traveling one way to New Orleans for a sports competition my wife was participating in. Needed to check a couple of bags, using a Kiosk. All in all check in took no more than 5 minutes, despite a busy morning at AUS. Spent time in the United Club, then went to the gate about 45 minutes prior to boarding. We fly often enough with Southwest, so we are familiar with the boarding process, which to tell the truth, if I have to fly coach, I prefer. We always pay the earlybird check in fee, we are always in group A, even though it's not guaranteed, so we always get a good choice of seats. Sitting together, had a window and aisle, row 2, as the flight was not full this morning. Fast boarding, on time departure, quick taxi and we were off. Rainy morning this morning, so take off was bumpy and drink service delayed, but once above the clouds, we were served the usual complimentary drinks and light snacks. 58 minutes later on the ground in MSY, a quick taxi and an on time arrival. Bags were off quicker than American Airlines ever does, even when priority bags are attached. Over all a good value, quick trip, on time, nice crew, comfortable, clean plane. In short the usual Southwest experience.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

Southwest Airlines,8,S Carter,11th March 2017,"Verified Review | Flight 5401, San Jose - Phoenix on Mar 4 2017 was uneventful, with on-time departure and arrival, along with the usual friendly in-flight service (one round of drinks and peanuts) by the Flight Attendants (FAs). The return flight 611, PHX – SJC on Mar 5 2017, scheduled to depart at 10.05 pm, was progressively delayed. At 5.59 pm, they moved the departure time to 10.45. At 6.31, they moved departure to 11.15. At 9.03 they changed departure to 11.45. We finally boarded, took our seats, and at 11.50 pm, right before push-back from the gate, an instrument (artificial horizon) broke. The pilot had to wait for another plane to land at PHX so mechanics could take that instrument from that plane and install it in ours. We finally departed at 12.15 am. Experiencing the delay get progressively extended, was a bit stressful, but eventually we made it to our destination, and on this flight the FAs again provided excellent service (even though I’m sure they had been as frustrated by the delay as the passengers were.","Aircraft Boeing 737

On time departure with normal Southwest courtesy on this route. Quick boarding, quick push-back and off we went. Luggage arrived in a timely manner in Vegas. Return flight was delayed by 15 minutes, then 30 minutes due to very high winds. Understandable. The captain let us know we would have a bumpy take off and some bumpy conditions on and off during the flight. No drink service during the flight due to the weather and the flight crew did apologize for that but when the captain wants everyone seated then that is it. Anyway the flight was not as bad as we were led to think. Was windy and snowing upon landing in Reno. All in all Southwest keeps delivering a good product on this flight and the ground staff and cabin crew do a good job.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

Southwest Airlines,1,P Dawson,25th February 2017,"Verified Review | This is the first and last time I fly Southwest. I'm very dissapointed after hearing nothing but great things about the airline. I flew in from Dallas Lovefield to Phoenix Arizona for a business meeting. On my way out of Dallas I found no line. But I did find two female Southwest employees at the check in counter chatting about the night before. They were very disinterested in being engaged with me during the chek in process but they got the job done and checked my bag in, as well as print my boarding pass for me. When it came time to board I was in the B group. That was far enough back to land me in the last row by the bathroom but at least it was an aisle seat. Great since I'm 28-going on 29 weeks pregnant and I may need to get up to use the rest room. I've only flown American and Delta with assigned seats. I hate this open seating policy because the person who came to sit next to me was a large man who barely fit into the middle seat and caused for an uncomfortable ride. I had to lean out toward the aisle the entire flight. Once we landed they open the back door to reload snacks and drinks for the plane that is going on to San Diego I believe. No big deal until the plan begins to get refueled! The fumes were so strong and awful. Fast forward a day, I'm pleased to go home to Dallas, hoping for better luck with my seat this time. Unfortunately my pass says I'm in group C. Even further out from boarding than on my flight in. At our boarding time of 5.15pm we were told that the flight crew for our flight will not even land until 5.45pm, that we may begin boarding at 6.10pm to leave at 6.30pm. This is all a maybe. You would think a company would have better logistics to get their staff here earlier or on time.","Type Of Traveller Business

Southwest Airlines,1,J Bova,11th February 2017,"Unverified | Newark to Orlando. Open seating policy. I've never flown Southwest Airlines before today. In fact we're still taxiing as I write this. I was told the night before that there is an open seating policy with Southwest but until boarding I didn't quite understand what that meant. For those of you who do not know, when you check-in you are assigned a zone and a number. This is the order by which you board and from there it's general admission. Maybe that sounds fine until you travel with your wife and kid and realize that you will be forced to rely on the general good will of the 160 people who have boarded the plane ahead of you in order to sit with your family. We were not so fortunate. Even when the entire plane of passengers was bribed with free drinks for the flight, there were still no takers. I boarded the plane only to find 14 or so empty middle seats. This is my first and last flight on Southwest Airlines. The stupidest airline in the sky.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

I have been flying Southwest since I was 18 (and before that, but not on my own dollar). I have the SWA Chase points card RapidRewards. I love that too. The only thing SWA does not offer is premium econ, between first class and coach, which I wish they did. Often on flights I give them my drink coupons or offer to pay and they don't let me, they will comp the drink, or a nearby passenger will share coupons. Not sure why but the people who choose to fly SWA are pretty awesome. Great baggage handling and free bags. Excellent flight change policy: it is free, and if you need to catch a flight from another airline, they will try to help, which has saved me a huge amount of stress and dollars.

However inflight services by pilots and cabin crew are and have always been fantastic for me, the airline has been on time and in most cases saved 20 mins from jetway to jetway. I had one flight that was 20 mins late only because the pilots had a false engine reverse thruster alarm sound when landing from the previous flight which the mechanics corrected promptly and without incident.

However, even with over 30 seats empty, I still had someone sit in the middle seat next to me, because I obviously can't choose where others sit. I didn't receive my free drink because of weather. So I paid $400 extra to board early, which gave me no advantage. I can't even believe they have a business option with just these insignificant advantages. My flight home again had many open seats but alas I had a middle seat occupant yet again. This was my first time flying Southwest and I will never ever fly with them again.

I have been an A-list preferred member for the entire time, typically exceeding the minimum number of points required by 10,000 or more points per year.

This year, I have 69,977 points, which is 23 points short of qualifying for A-List Preferred status. I asked if, based on the fact I've exceeded the points level for the past 4 years, they could allow me to keep A-List Preferred status for 2017 because I was only 23 points short. They said no.

Unfortunately, my flight into Tucson was also delayed. So I was delayed coming and going. Southwest employees act as if this is not of any great importance. To their customers it is a very big deal. I have flown on a variety of airlines and Southwest is the worst for being on the time. Flight times don't allow for any ""unforeseen"" events. I am disappointed and frustrated with Southwest. I would not recommend using this airline to anyone.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

The flight attendants have been passive aggressive and the Captain virtually not understandable when he/she decides to speak. This particular flight was the worst. We were already delayed and then sat on the tarmac for almost 30 mins. I don't know what happened to Southwest, but please go back to the way it was.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest airlines knew of the impending snow storm yet they boarded the plane at 9:45 pm and made all the passengers sit on the tarmac for over 3.5 hours before diverting the plane back to the gate. Southwest offered no direction except to stand in that line and rebook. The line wrapped around the terminal. I went home and never got to my destination.

Southwest Airlines,5,Mike Colucci,15th December 2016,"Columbus to Las Vegas. Very disappointed in Southwest. I was told by a Southwest employee that if I transferred my chase sapphire points to Southwest rewards, that those points would count towards my companion pass. When I went to book a flight the other night I was told they do not count. After talking to numerous Southwest employees, I was told nothing could be done and they offered me a USD50 voucher. I would have never transferred those chase points if I had known that. They are worth over USD800 in travel thru chase. I feel that I lost both ways and Southwest is not honoring what one of there employees told me. I like flying Southwest and will continue to do so.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,D Christensen,14th December 2016,"Very happy with Southwest Airlines. Traveled from Minneapolis to Phoenix with my wife and 5 kids (ages 1,3,5,7 and 9). It has been many years since I have flown and never for any of the kids. First got to the check in counter and baggage drop off in Minneapolis - not knowing procedure we were greeted right away with a smile and very friendly employee. We were checked in right away and given instructions on where to go and what we would need to do when we got to the gate with our stroller. Proceeded to go through security, again nervous as to how smoothly this would go with all the horrible stories I have heard. TSA agent checking our id's was very friendly and good about telling us where to go and what was expected of us to get though security. Got to the Southwest gate and before I could even get over to the agent he came over asked about the stroller and went back to the counter and came back a minute later with a claim ticket and label for our stroller. They explained we would board after the A ticket holders and wheel chairs as a family. We boarded the plane got to pick our seats 3 on the left side and 4 on the right with the 1 year old on my wifes lap. All Southwest attendants were nice and friendly during the flight. Landed in Arizona and got off the plane with no issues, got to baggage claim and our bads were already there waiting on the conveyor. On our way home it was just as good. Overall I was very pleased with Southwest and their staff. A great price compared to other options.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Southwest Airlines,9,B Keeling,8th December 2016,"Verified Review | Phoenix to Spokane WA. No problems. Even though I was the last of about 150 people boarding (having misunderstood the online preboarding process, I wound up having to get my boarding pass at the airport) and had to take a middle seat between two guys, who both seemed to be recovering from chest colds, my 2.2-hour run from Phoenix to Spokane was fine. Nice staff at both ends of the process. Seat not too tight. Neighboring passengers courteous. A fair boarding process. No delays. The price: not a terrific deal (my round-trip ticket between Spokane and Phoenix was just below $500), but not ruinously expensive, and this was, after all, Thanksgiving. I feel positive about this trip partly because of my last flight, from Honolulu to Ithaca, NY. That was via United. United treated coach-class passengers like sacks of dirt. It canceled a flight (D.C. to Syracuse) with no better excuse than that it was under-booked, offered no apologies, made people stand in line for one hour to get alternative routing, ultimately made me spend an extra night in Syracuse, at a cost of about $100. By comparison, this experience at Southwest was wonderful. Until I'm disabused of my faith in Southwest, I'll happily board it again.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Southwest Airlines,2,Todd McCallister,5th December 2016,"The first, only and last time we will be traveling with Southwest. They say ""open seating"" makes the boarding faster. It doesn't. It makes it easier on their end because they do not have to spend the labor on seat selections, etc. It is more like being treated like cattle in a chute. When you get to the plane, you are still waiting to get seated, just like every other airline out there. If you are lucky, you might get to sit with your other family members. Our family was not the only one that had to sit scattered throughout the plane. The attempts at humor by the flight staff did not help much either. The seats were cramped to point my shoulders hust from being so scrunched up and I am not that big of a person, 5'10"", 220lbs. The beverage service gets you about 4 sips of your drink unless you order coffee or adult beverage. One of our pieces of luggage was severely damaged so we got a $50 coupon to be used on Southwest airlines and only on Southwest airlines. I think we are throwing it away. They found more ways to nickel and dime more money out of passenger fares.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,Suzanne Bryan,26th November 2016,"Verified Review | Seattle to Sacramento. My husband and I flew with our 6 month old for the first time so we could go visit family for Thanksgiving. We chose Southwest because it was literally half the price than other airlines during the holidays. We had never travelled with children before so we had our hands full with the stroller and car seat. While boarding, a man came up behind me and said ""Can I help with those?"" I said sure not realizing it was the pilot right away. He carried my car seat and stroller and waited in line with us. I told him not to worry and he could go ahead since he had more important things to do, but he waited and seemed happy to help. While descending, our son was screaming so loud, and the lovely flight attendant, came over right away and entertained him until he smiled and settled down. After landing and exiting the plane, I apologized to the staff and other passengers for my son making such a scene, but everyone was very friendly and understanding. We had such a great experience with Southwest!","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Comfortable economy seats, friendly staff, and flexibility. If they expanded their international travel, I would exclusively fly with them. I was planning on taking my parents to spend Christmas with my sister and nieces in another state but ended up needing to cancel my travel plans due to my mother becoming unexpectedly sick. The employees that I have spoke with thus far have been wonderful. We were able to come up with a solution that allowed me to keep my travel funds and I will be using them toward another trip with Southwest at a later time.

Southwest Airlines,2,Steven Allen,20th November 2016,"I have been flying Southwest for over ten years and have the southwest credit card as well. I put several thousands of dollars on it a year but have noticed that I get a lot less flights with it now. I liked how they started giving you a boarding number when you check in 24 hours in advance so there aren't people arguing about the lines. But now what people are doing is saving seats all the time and it has gotten carried away. I have talked to the flight attendants about it but they say they will not get involved with it. I check in 24 hours in advance on the dot to get the best seats possible but am going farther and farther back from people saving seats now. What the customers are doing is one will get the early bird pass to get an advanced seating number and then save the remaining seats for the passengers that are flying with them. I actually was going to sit down on one flight and a woman said she was saving seven seats which was three rows and I finally said no, you cannot do that since my boarding pass was before them. She started getting loud and the flight attendant was no help whatsoever. I am not going back any further on the plane simply because others are not working with the rules Southwest has determined and does nothing for the people who play by the rules. I know this sounds petty, but I can have A tickets and cannot get seats for me and my wife until near the back of the plane. I tell the flight attendant about it and they do not respond so no more Southwest for me.","Aircraft Boeing 737-800

Southwest Airlines,9,Jaret Rapp,8th November 2016,"Verified Review | Ft Lauderdale to Las Vegas. I like Southwest Airlines. The rates are reasonable. There are no hidden fees, or change fees, or bag fees. They serve snacks and drinks and for free. In all my flights, the flight crew has been friendly, and this last round trip flight was no exception. People who work for Southwest in my experience seem happy to do so. The planes are all Boeing 737's and for economy class seating, there is better space than many other airlines. The inflight entertainment is via wifi on your own device, which means no footwell intrusions from IFE boxes or bulky seatbacks. Some people are taken aback by Southwest's open seating policy, but its never been an issue for me. On the return leg of this last flight was on a brand new 737-800, only two months old and still had that new plane smell. Both of my flights left on time and landed early. I have no complaints about my experience.","Aircraft Boeing 737-800

I needed to change the return flight for one of these tickets without changing the flight for everyone on the reservation. Since you cannot do this online without changing the entire reservation, I was able to get my flight changed with one simple phone call that lasted all of 8 minutes including the automated menu and hold time. This change also did not cost me extra! This was a nice surprise considering is took me 6 months to get American Airlines to acknowledge that they need to reimburse me for a flight I was never on! It was pleasant calling 1 number and speaking to a person rather then calling 13 different numbers and getting the same automated message.

Southwest Airlines,2,J Johnson,2nd November 2016,"Verified Review | Flew Austin to Phoenix. Southwest Airlines used to be my favorite airline to fly particularly because of how easy it was to cancel and change flights, their rewards program, and especially how helpful their attendants were. Over time, some of their best value points have changed. Their reward system has made it more difficult to receive reward flights. There was a time that you could show up to the airport early, and if their was a seat available on an earlier flight, they would accommodate you, but they no longer do this without charging you the fare difference which is really expensive on a day of flight. I must say worst of all is their service and customer service. Each Southwest Airlines personnel that you deal with from the time you check in, until exiting the plane is rude or in a bad mood, unwilling to help or accommodate your needs. I have a service animal, and three times, at three different points within one round trip experience I was harassed after being cleared twice. I was humiliated and embarrassed. I will no longer fly with SWA unfortunately. I truly used to enjoy the experience, but their service has gone too far downhill.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Unfortunately, this time around was far from a pleasant experience. Flew from Dallas to Kansas City. It was my first time checking a car seat and stroller at the gate so I wasn't quite sure of the process. The woman 'helping' was rude, and even made a snide comment in regards to me not understanding where to sign the liability tags. We, my 2 young daughter's (1 & 11) and myself, loaded the plane last. I was concerned about having 2 seats together, and the stewardess was less than accommodating. She did say she would find 2 middle seats close together but that was the best she could do. Fortunately, an older gentleman gave his seat up for us to sit next to each other. I graciously thanked the man, and then thanked the stewardess whom then told me not to thank her and that I needed to thank him. Thankfully the gentleman who was collecting boarding passes was the only pleasant encounter I had. He insisted on taking the stroller and car seat for us because our hands were full, and made sure to go ahead of us and tell the flight crew that we would need 2 seats together so they could begin working on it. Clearly the accommodation wasn't taken into consideration but I appreciate this man for being the only thing positive thing I can say about Southwest during this trip.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,V Blosser,23rd October 2016,"Phoenix to Seattle. My flight from Seattle to Phoenix I would rate that trip an 8/9 score (flight attendants were very friendly and helpful from the time I checked in until my exit from the plane. Their concern was that I was comfortable and in the least amount of pain throughout the flying experience with them). Return flight was a whole different type of experience. My flight returning from Phoenix to Seattle (flight 2193) was horrific. I have disabilities that require a cane and a wheel chair at times. During the pre board the wheel chair assisted individuals were squeezed in between other passengers loading (very chaotic) we were barely noticed that we needed to board before the crowds pushed in. The employee that seemed to be in charge at the time, taking the tickets grabbed my wheel chair and quickly/aggressively pushed my wheel chair so fast/hard over the turns and bumps in the ramp that I told him twice to stop and slow down. He was rude to customers loading the plane. He left me and walked away at the entrance of the plane (did not secure the wheel chair, lift the foot pads or help get the luggage off of my lap or give me my cane). I was then met by another rude Southwest flight attendant that just watched me struggle to get out of the wheelchair and try to set my luggage down. She did not once offer to help in anyway. I told her I need to get the luggage in the overhead bin and she just stared at me with an attitude on her face/body language. I finally said that my luggage would just sit there because I couldn't put it in the overhead bin. She finally grabbed the bag and put it up. I asked for my cane that was put in the overhead area so I could use the rest room and again with the attitude when assistance was needed. When it was time to exit the plane not one Southwest employee helped any or the 8 disabled customers with luggage or anything. The customers on the flight are the ones that assisted the disabled customers.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,L Pulliam,21st October 2016,"Reno to Las Vegas return. I fly this route several times a year and Southwest delivers a fine product. This time we were traveling with our 90 year old father who requires assistance and wheelchair which we requested. The wheelchair was waiting for us at the airport when we arrived and we were assisted by very nice ground staff all the way to entering the plane. We had to gate check his walker which was promptly waiting for us when we arrived in Las Vegas along with a wheelchair and more assistance from the ground crew. It was all very well done. On our return flight we ran into all kinds of horrible traffic delays due to the Presidential Debate taking place just a few blocks away from the airport. The highways and roads were all closed leading to the airport so when we realized that we would not make our flight we called Customer Service, explained our situation and rebooked for a later flight. The agent was understanding, very pleasant and had us rebooked at no charge within 5 minutes. Upon arrival at the airport a wheelchair was waiting and again the ground crew offered great assistance all the way to the plane. We again gate checked his walker and it was waiting for us upon arrival in Reno along with a wheelchair.

You don't pay for checked luggage. The price you're shown is the total price without added expense. Yes, I paid $40 for expedited boarding but that was my choice to avoid having a middle seat.

Southwest Airlines,10,H Lanney,10th October 2016,"Verified Review | Orlando to Baltimore Washington. We headed to Orlando for our couple vacation. Beautiful, until Hurricane Matthew showed up. We had to leave 2 days earlier, 6th October. Very anxious moments indeed. Southwest gate and ticket agents assisted us greatly from being on ""standby"" to being the last 3 passengers to board non stop to BWI. These ladies are professionals who under pressure got us as passengers to our destinations safely. Please thank the professional pilots, flight attendants and ground crew for their outstanding performance and professional work ethic in such a time of crisis.","Aircraft Boeing 737-500

Southwest Airlines,3,F Arnold,3rd October 2016,"Tampa to St. Louis with Southwest Airlines. No assigned seats are a problem. If you are lucky, you are in the A group to board ahead of B and C group, but people who paid an extra fee to board first save seats for their party (who have not paid the fee) and you can end up sitting further back. I paid the fee last time and another passengers was saving a seat across the aisle with their purse. Another was saving 2seats for companions in the C boarding group. The flight attendants see this all the time and do nothing about it and let it happen. I no longer want to fly Southwest - it is too frustrating.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

However what happened today will result in me never flying with them again. My mother needs special assistance, and it is not allowed to make a disabled person reveal whatever it is that makes them disabled! Because my mother does not ""look"" like she needs assisantance, a staff member made her describe what made her need assistance, and behaved in the most intolerant way. I will never be back.

Southwest Airlines,9,D Roberts,2nd October 2016,"Verified Review | I'm going to start off by saying that the check-in agent was very friendly and helpful, making sure I knew where to go not only in Norfolk International, but also in Baltimore. Because I paid the cheapest fare, I was one of the last people on. Luckily it wasn't a full flight so I still got an aisle seat. The plane was clean. The flight attendant giving the safety announcement, as per apparent Southwest policy, made the speech into a comedy routine (much needed on a red-eye). For those who don't know, the flight from Norfolk to Baltimore usually takes a maximum of fifty minutes; this time it was more along the lines of thirty-five. Despite this short timeframe, however, the crew made sure we all got our snacks and drinks (though I didn't have any). I have usually had good experiences flying on Southwest, and this flight was no exception.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

We bought ""wanna getaway"" tickets that were cheap and all flights left on time and there were no problems. I read online previously that you must check in exactly 24hours before your flight to make sure you get your seats, which we always did (we set alarms to remind us 24 hours before on the dot!) Staff were friendly and we loved that this airline has no hidden costs and a big suitcase each flies free. Would definitely recommend these guys!!","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,2,Ellie Kreale,19th September 2016,"Verified Review | Reno to Los Angeles return. Southwest Airlines is spiraling into a bad, dark place. Seems it has now become SWA company policy to have even the most pedestrian 70 minute flight delayed by more than 2 hours. There is no reason for this. There was no weather. There was no equipment failure. There were no technical glitches. And to boot the phone agent kept trying to get me to take a standby flight to Las Vegas instead of getting me home to LAX where my car, family, life and all that matters to me are. Not only can this airline not handle the simple logistics of shuttling equipment back and forth between two cities that take 70 minutes to fly between, their incompetent phone staff cannot understand the difference between Los Angeles, CA and Las Vegas, NV.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,2,B Keener,18th September 2016,"Verified Review | Baltimore to Las Vegas with Southwest Airlines. Flying home after a weekend with friends our flight was delayed as the aircraft was stuck in San Diego due to fog. Our original flight was due to leave at 11:10am. The fog was cleared by about 10am by the weather service. Still this 40 minute flight has not left yet and is now scheduled to leave after noon. We were rebuffed after several attempts to rebook and told no available seating although when you go online there are expensive tickets available later in the day. The gate representative basically said it is not her fault and she can't help us or do anything to compensate us as there was fog in San Diego. If we can't get out today she will try to rebook us tomorrow. We can email to complain and as previous reviewers have said, that's not very effective either. Southwest used to be my go to airline - now it's becoming as bad as Delta and that's pretty bad.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,9,S Sanchez,31st August 2016,"Verified Review | Originally booked a flight from San Jose to Phoenix (and return) with Southwest Airlines. At the airport, the flight from San Jose was cancelled due to mechanical problems with the plane. I received a text alert even before an announcement was made at the boarding gate, so I made my way to a customer service counter. The agent was fast and to the point, while remaining courteous. I ended up being re-routed through John Wayne (Orange County) airport, and eventually arrived at Phoenix less than 3 hours after my original flight. For my troubles, I received a $200 voucher, which is more than what I paid for the round-trip. I was impressed by how quickly they found a solution to the cancelled flight, and amazed by the financial compensation.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

Southwest Airlines,9,S Andrews,22nd August 2016,"Verified Review | Traveled by myself from Grand Rapids to Philadelphia with a stop in Chicago Midway. Looked at prices for other airlines and I saw nothing less than $350 round trip. A co-worker suggested I check Southwest Airlines website since they don't pop up on Priceline and other travel websites and found the same flight for $240. Good first impression there. When I arrived I learned that my first flight from GRR to MDW was delayed 45 minutes as the plane was stuck in IAD - however, the attendants seemed very eager to get us to our destination and boarded those with close connecting flights first so they wouldn't miss them. I was impressed even further by the friendliness of the ground service. Great sense of humor. This was a reoccurring theme on each flight. Planes were clean and well maintained. I understand some of the planes received new seats which supposedly are far superior to the old ones. Wasn't super comfortable but better than any I've sat in on an American Airlines flight. I purchased wifi for 8 bucks and it lasted for the entire day, so I used it on both flights even though I had to change planes. Cabin service was efficient with a large selection of drinks. Attendants were very personable and helpful. I like how they read gate info before landing. Also worth noting that I travelled alone. I can see how their open seating process could negatively effect groups of people traveling together. They do offer family boarding after the A group boards which was neat to see. I landed a first row seat 3 of my 4 flights and it was very spacious but all carry on must be stored above. If you're traveling light it's worth climbing over a few people as the leg room was fantastic. Overall great first impression of Southwest. No large complaints worth noting. Can't beat their prices. It's hard to find good rates to bigger cities when flying out of an airport as small as Grand Rapids. Will definitely fly again.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

Southwest Airlines,2,V Harrold,22nd August 2016,Nashville to Tampa with Southwest Airlines. My flight was cancelled with minimum notice. They had the entire full flight go to the 2 agents at the gate to rebook (they did not even tell people there was an option to go up front to check-in). Being A-List Preferred I called the number and they tried to put me in an open seat on the 1:55pm flight but they could not help because somehow SWA closed making reservation changes to them from flight 37. After the A List plus folks could not help I went to front check in but they had no ability to get me out until the 9:45pm flight. Despite my Business Select fare I got a boarding pass with position B5 on it. When I complained I paid the high fare and was A-List Preferred they said they could do nothing but I could try to better myself (13 hours later) at the gate. They also said if I called back Monday they would connect me with customer service. In addition to going out 13 hours later I had to wait 1 hour to get my bag back and leaving the airport paid $12 for parking that would have been included in my regular parking fee for 24 hours. On Monday I again called the A List Preferred number to be connected to the customer service to complain as I was told Sunday. They instead told me to send an e-mail. You have no idea how frustrating this has all been. Not only did I not get to meet the people I was to have lunch with Sunday I arrived at my hotel well after 1AM (flight landed at 12:20AM) to have to be at my office a 7AM meeting. I did want to talk to someone who will explain why SWA will not let me verbally complain and maybe get SWA to think how badly they handle these situations. To this date they have refused to reply to my emails.,"Aircraft Boeing 737

While it was an inconvenience at least we had peace of mind. Safery first. The Captain and crew took the time to explain the problem and were prompt and courteous getting us boarded on the new plane and on our way. On our flight back to Dallas (flight 3137) the flight crew was very friendly and made our early morning flight a breeze. Loved the jokes and sense of humor.

Plane was clean and comfortable. Mixed drinks are only $5, snacks are good. Boarding is first come, first serve, but my daughter and husband and I all found seats next to each other even boarding in the ""C"" line. Luggage all arrived at our destination. Only negative is that they charge $8 for WiFi, which is excessive for a 2 hour flight.

Southwest Airlines,2,Maureen Rogers,27th July 2016,"Albuquerque, NM to San Antonio, TX via Dallas, Love Field TX. I have been making about 8 to 10 flights a year for at least 9 years. My family lives in RI, and I live in NM. So I travel cross country once or twice a year, plus vacation and work trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Quebec, Mexico, and last winter Cambodia. I have always attempted to fly Southwest Airlines in the past, whenever traveling (domestic) to a location that they have service to, and I generally try to avoid American Airlines. Over the last few years flying is less and less of a faster trip, due to lengthy waits in security, and the expectation that we travelors arrive at the airport earlier and earlier, as well as layovers that get longer and more frequent delays. In the last couple of years I have come to expect that, unless I am flying on the very first flight of the day, I will be delayed. I have mentally added that time to overall travel time, when planning a trip. Southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay, and I now expect it. Today, Southwest outdid themselves. I think I may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. Maybe I would rather stay home. There have been several moments today when I wished that I could leave the airport and just go home. Why am I so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway? I can go swimming in Albuquerque. The first such moment was when I got to the airport at 7:00 am for my 8:55 flight only to discover that it does not exist anymore. It was posted as delayed, now it's just gone. I have to wait until I am called to be told how I will be rerouted. So now I am leaving an hour and 50 minutes later, to make a Dallas flight that will take off about 2 hours later. So I can still pick up my rental car during daylight. I make it to Dallas, I get on the plane, we are a bit delayed because we need to get some more gas because we need to fly around some heavy traffic to get to San Antonio. No we are now waiting an additional hour and 45, due to bad weather. Well, ok, I can still do my drive before it gets dark (I've never driven in San Antonio). I can even get off the plane if I want, I will just have to reboard (because that is so much fun). So it is really pretty hot in here, but it is too late to go home. We can leave now, (so they say). We just have to wait for the passengers to get back on the plane. Did Southwest get new management? Is this a new marketing scheme?","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,David Graubard,22nd July 2016,"Writing this review not as a passenger but as the uncle of my nephew who attempted to fly from Chicago Midway to Albuquerque on WN 563 on July 21st. Yes - Southwest had a computer meltdown and their flights were all messed up. This has happened before to them and other airlines. But alas it always comes down to how an airline handles things like this that differentiates them from others. My nephew is Italian and doesn't speak English fluently and is 14, so I needed to get the Escort pass from the ticket counter. The line was over 1,000 people long if not more, stretching into back halls. I told the SW agents at the line entrances I just needed to get the Escort pass as he can't go thru alone. No - no help. Rude people who just say - get in line. There was no one at the Business Fare line - literally no one - and she wouldn't just let me go up there to get the pass. I had used a Skycap to check his bag in as that line was only 50 people long, so literally just needed the agent to give me the pass. Not a single SW person helped me - but going back to the Skycap - he did! He stopped what he was doing and walked me back to the counter and had an agent quickly issue me the pass. So simple - didn't really stop the process of handling other passengers. Just for this I wouldn't fly SW again - there was no reason the Biz counter couldn't have helped me (and 2 other passengers needing just a quick minute with an agent. So we go thru security - eat and go to the gate where it says ""on time"". Some flights delayed, some cancelled, some on time. They board other flights, at our boarding time they have people line up, flight attendants already on board. Then an announcement: ""Flight 536 is cancelled, we have no pilots, please get in line for rebooking"". No apology - in fact the 4 hours at Midway not a single SWA agent said I'm sorry for what was happening - just deal with it. So I get on the SWA app and the only flight I can get for my nephew is on the 23rd of June. Ok - so now ask an agent how I can get his bag. No - no way, we are not pulling bags from flights. I said he is 14 and has no clothes here as he is visiting. Sorry - we are not pulling bags. I said some choice words to her and then she says to speak to a supervisor. Wait 45 min in line - the supervisor says no - with a smile - and I can try to go to baggage claim and see if someone there would help. So I go to baggage claim - and the agent there is friendly - but she is just guiding people as that line is 20 people long. She said the bag will go to ABQ and just let it go. If I wait in the line they may not pull it, or if they do it could be hours. At least she was friendly. So for 2 days my nephew will not have any of his things - not a dire situation - he can wear my clothes. But again - it was just the sheer nature of the SWA agents. No compassion, not friendly, not helpful. I will never spend a single penny at Southwest again. SWA has gotten too big for its britches - they used to be good in the 80s and 90s, now just one of the Big 4 and treating passengers like cattle. Lets see if the flight tomorrow goes out on time or at all, I have my fingers crossed.","Aircraft Boeing 737-800

Finally, no other flights available, this flight is canceled all together. All other bookings were available until Sunday July 24th. Useless for us, since we were coming back on Sunday. I shifted gears quicker than Southwest and booked a flight with JetBlue for an additional $1000 to fly out the next day.

Southwest Airlines,1,Julia Paolucci,21st July 2016,"Verified Review | We have always had a great experience when flying with Southwest and with their customer service. For this reason, we have always been willing to pay the extra dollars to book our flights through them, as opposed to booking with one of the cheaper airlines. However, the last 3 times we have flown Southwest have been just awful. They lost our car seat the first time, our luggage the second time, and then the third time we experienced a 3.5 hour delay followed by a cancelled flight at 9.30pm. On top of this, we have encountered terrible customer service every step of the way in dealing with these stressful circumstances. Each time we traveled the personnel working at the ticket counter have been unbelievably rude. Great way to start the trip. When items were lost, instead of being helpful and accommodating, the customer service agent working in lost baggage was very brusque and actually yelled at us, and then refused to do something as simple as validate a $7 parking ticket for my husband who had to park and come in to help me with the situation since I was traveling alone with our 6 month old. Finally, when we were flying home to Denver, our flight was delayed 3.5 hours and then cancelled. The entire time the woman working the gates to the flight was yelling at people and being extremely rude. We all had to wait 1-2 hours in line to rebook our flights, and then we found out the next day when we called in that they never even rebooked a flight for us. We will be leaving 2 days after our expected and paid for departure date. On top of all of this, we have not been compensated for any of these inconveniences.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,A Davidson,7th July 2016,"Verified Review | Flew Southwest from Phoenix to Orange County on a Saturday evening. I checked-in using self-serve kiosk at the airport. Kiosk gave me a temporary pass that I needed to collect my real boarding pass at the gate. Security lines were very short in Phoenix that evening. Agent at the gate was very courteous and professional despite having just dealt with an unhappy customer before me. Inside the cabin, I was surprised by how energetic and jovial the flight attendants were despite the flight being on a Saturday evening.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Usually on time or a few minutes delay but nothing to worry about. Service is good, ground staff were excellent as we were running late and checked in about 30 minutes before take off. Reno airport is a breeze to go through so never any lines at TSA. Our bags made it on to the flight even though we got the dreaded Late Check-In tag. Quick flight to Vegas, friendly FA's, pilot communicated with us, typical beverage and peanut service, bags quick to pick up in Vegas and then the same coming back to Reno.

We hadn't flown in a long time so it was uncomfortable to begin with. Of course, I was not okay with this and began to complain. The flight attendant said that I needed to take a seat. So I did and I told him how unsatisfied I was with the airline. He was like well you're still going to need to take a seat. I sat down and said that I'm going to write a complaint about the airline. What if I had children, someone who had extreme anxiety, or another issue. Luckily that was not the case, but they should do something about the seating process. When we purchased the tickets it said entertainment such as tv, movies and wifi would be included. There was not one tv and the wifi did not work.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,Kelly Padilla,11th May 2016,"Denver to Cancun with Southwest Airlines. We were a group travelling for a wedding on 1 flight. No one was able to sit together. The boarding process is ridiculous, you have the first people boarding sitting in the aisle or window seats, leaving the middle seats for the tailend of boarding. Out of 20 people in our group we were able to sit together here and there. Additionally, why allow large carry on luggage? It would make more sense to limit the carry on because that is what slows down the boarding process, not assigned seating. This is most likely the last time I will fly Southwest - there is no care or concern for families traveling together, even if I have to pay more it will be worth it to have the ability to travel with my family and friends.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

So my daughter checks in 24 hours before scheduled flight and gets preboard A-30. So I pay for ""Early Board"" option and she boards ahead of me ?

I file complaint after completing travel and was reimbursed the payment for the ""Early Bird"" option but was told they will do it this time but sometimes it happens?

Southwest Airlines,4,P Norton,4th May 2016,"Why bother to upgrade on Southwest? Flew from Providence to Tampa. On the first flight there were 17 wheelchairs that delayed the flight for over 25 minutes. We ended up more than halfway back in the plane despite the A boarding. On landing, hearing first on last off, only 3 individuals required assistance. Arriving early at the airport today I observed six people going to Baltimore in wheelchairs, 3 walked a fair distance to get coffee, afterwards one even ""hobbled up"" to the gate person to make sure she didn't need ""real documentation"". On my boarding later there was a family of 6, one about aged six, pre-boarding. I asked and was told it was a disability issue. Really? Four or five people needed for one teenager or maybe the 6/year old? As a former special needs and kindergarten teacher I get it, but as a consumer I know an abuse of the system too. I will not pay to upgrade and perhaps not fly Southwest again. I don't think the airline will change as long as this is ignored by consumers.","Aircraft Boeing 737-800

I was the last to board because my 2.5 year old had to go to the bathroom as people were getting in line to start boarding. Thank goodness we did not miss the flight. When we boarded (last) there were no two seats left together and an older male attendant muttered ""that's what happens when you board last when you have a child with you,"" as he passed us by. I was greatly offended as I could not control the circumstances. Two kind gentlemen gave up their seats for us. My son fell asleep soon after take off and the window blind was jammed/broken in a half closed position with the sunlight in my son's face. There was a ripped page of one of their brochures so I tucked it under the window blind. As we were about to land, another attendant annoyingly asked, ""Did you rip that? Give it to me"" and took it.

Southwest Airlines,10,S Hester,11th April 2016,"I fly from San Diego to San Antonio around 5 times per year, round trip. I always fly with Southwest. Their prices can't be beat for the quality you get. I personally like the seating setup, where you choose your seat based on a ""first come, first served"" basis regarding check in time. If you are traveling with young children, they do allow you to do family boarding after the small first round of people, so you can almost always find seats together. Seat room is a bit better than average, but nothing to write home about. Two free checked bags plus a carryon and personal item is unreal. Where Southwest really shines, however, is their customer service. They're funny, helpful, and always seem to be smiling. The flight attendants are especially good with kids. Overall, if you're used to high class flying, this may not be the airline for you as it lacks the preselected seating option and has only one class. But if you just want to be comfortable and have a good experience, I wouldn't choose anything but Southwest.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Because Southwest Airlines does not have pre-assigned seatings, it takes so much longer for everyone to board. Most people leave the middle seats unoccupied as the plane gets filled.

Also the little girl sitting next to me was celebrating her 6th B-Day and she received special treatment which was nice to see. The flight home was actually ahead of schedule and about 75% full. Said my hello to the lady sitting next to me and before I knew it we were up in the air. Smooth flight home. Flight crew were friendly and didn't even charge for cocktails. Nice!

You can change you flight (day/time) with no additional fees unless the cost of that day is more, they also give you first come first served seating, and they give you one free drink and snacks on the plane. The downfall is that all their flights have layovers so a trip that would normally be a couple hours ends up being 4-5hrs. You also get 2 free checked bags and free wifi!","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,Alexis Boddie,20th February 2016,"Chicago Midway to Tampa. This was my first time flying with my 4 year old son, and it turned out to be a great experience. We missed our flight but Southwest gave us a new flight at no charge that was 2 hours later. When it was time to be seated the customer service was very pleasant. I asked a lot of question because it was my first time flying, also my son's. The staff passed out a free drink and peanuts to all passengers. Being able to bring 2 free bags each passenger plus a free carryon was a win-win situation. I was very pleased to have such a pleasant experience. Everything was better than expected.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,Richard Kranzel,13th February 2016,Arrived at Mcaron airport on day of flight. Flight was boarded then cancelled. Was put on next available flight which also was cancelled. Ended up being routed to Sacramento. Then it cost me more money to get from Sacramento to reno than the original ticket cost. Cost me $40.00 roundtrip just to pick up my bag at Reno airport. Total cost between airport food gas mileage etc around $380.00 Original ticket $222.98 . I'm a disabled veteran on a fixed income. I asked for a refund of the original ticket cost. Southwest took five business days to approve the refund no thanks to there customer service center. After five days I had to call the corporate office in Dallas and was lucky enough to get someone on the phone who could at the least push my claim through to approval status. I got every every excuse imaginable from there customer service reps but the one constant was that this was there policy on refunds and I would just have to wait. They took my money immediately out of my account when I bought the ticket so why is so hard for them to put it back. Seriously the IRS processes tax returns faster than Southwest will process a customer refund. As of this posting I still have not received my refund and with a holiday weekend here I guess I'll be lucky to see it by next week. Shame on you Southwest airlines. I trusted you would have better business sense than to hold peoples money hostage. Your customer service reps are under trained and give different answers.,"Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,2,Evan White,12th February 2016,"Indianapolis to Las Vegas, and flying with Southwest Airlines was one of the worst flying experiences I have had. I paid $8 to have wifi throughout the flight, but any simple google search takes about a minute to load. Netflix does not work on the wifi. After realizing this, I then spent another $5 on a movie to watch. In order to watch the movie in flight, you have to install an app to view it. I installed the app about 13 times, on both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, however I was still not able to watch the movie that I bought. Overall I wasted $13 on wifi services that are expected to work. Very disappointed.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,5,Joel Delavergne,11th February 2016,"Detroit to Denver. We tried booking tickets using Southwest Rapids reward card immediately after signing up. When we called Chase to sign up they said we could use card once approved but had to contact another branch of Chase to get card number to book tickets. We called Chase-2 and they could not give card number but said if we sign up online we could use the card to book Southwest tickets. We canceled phone activated application and signed up on Southwest online. Account was approved and activated by Chase but could only see the last 4 numbers of account. Security, I get it! So we contacted Chase-3 again and they said we should have had the trip in our Southwest checkout online. I check and we did have the trip in our checkout and still couldn't book the trip. What a run around! We ended up using our DELTA card to book our Southwest trip. We are planning many trips this year so were trying to get the 25,000 reward miles by spending $1000 - no problem!

Southwest Airlines,8,Kathy Sands,9th February 2016,"We were happy to have a direct Southwest Airlines flight from Buffalo to Las Vegas. The customer service was pleasant. Another reason we would choose Sothwest again is because of the leg room. Compared to our last flight on another airline where we were totally cramped, especially with the person in front of me reclining, I was able to stretch my legs comfortably. I have a broken hip and arthritic knees but was able to sit through the whole flight. I liked the free TV and WIFI also after I was able to connect. Both flights arrived on time. The only negative is the open seating although I was able to sit next to my husband both ways. I would choose Southwest again.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

No waiting in line while passengers ahead of you struggled to get roll aboard into overhead bins and lots of room in these bins for hand luggage.

Southwest Airlines,8,Daniel Mitchell,10th January 2016,"On Southwest, you get what you pay for. This time, however, I got better than I expected. The itinerary had a departure from San Juan at 5:40 am with a stop in Orlando and a transfer in Denver. The flight ultimately let us off at San Francisco at 1:00 pm, making the entire trip 13 hours. Fortunately, Southwest featured free DirecTV on an electronic device and movie rentals for $5.00 each, covering entertainment for the first two flights. The DEN-SFO leg was an older plane, so there was no entertainment option. There were no full meals, but the flight attendants had a stash of snacks and refreshments for all three flights. Seat comfort was questionable and there was only one bathroom, but that's the expectation for the airline that sells tickets $400 cheaper than any other. Ultimately, I was quite impressed by the flexibility and price of the flight, and I recommend Southwest to an budget traveler.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700 / 737-300

I was pleasantly surprised to see that I would not be penalized for changing my flight date so I could be with my family. I was surprised that all I had to do was pay the remaider if the flight I changed to was more expensive or I would receive a credit if it was cheaper.

Southwest Airlines,6,Tim Pitman,6th January 2016,"Ontario to Sacramento. This is more of a review on the so called rapid ""reward"" program of Southwest. I fly routinely from Southern California to Sacramento and had built up points to qualify for the ""A"" list of the reward system. I knew I was going to be a little short on the required points but I also had a flight scheduled for the 30th December. I ended up purchasing the tier qualifying points and knew I had the points coming from the flight that was scheduled on the 30th which would have put me way over the needed points. So when I inquired about the status I was told that the flight on the 30th December did not count for 2015 but rather for 2016. When I asked for an explanation I was told something that did not make sense and questioned the person about this that all of a sudden the explanation changed, I then asked for a refund of the tier points that I had purchased as was told ""Sorry but you should have known those were non-refundable? When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told this person who refused to give me his name was the Executive Director of customer relations. He then stated, ""Sorry but there is nothing that he can do"". He didn't even try to make it right but rather tried to come up with different excuses. Also he knew very little about the policies as I was placed on hold several times while he consulted with another co-worker. This is what happens when a company loses sight of what made them what they are - and that is the Customer.","Type Of Traveller Business

Southwest Airlines,10,T Blackwell,6th January 2016,I get terribly motion sick so I have chosen to drive for years. This trip from Charlotte to New Orleans via Houston driving was not an option. I was anxious that I would be sick and miserable the whole flight. Thankfully I was not and the Southwest Airlines crew were friendly and funny. On both legs of the flight we were delayed a bit due to bad weather but the connecting flight waited for the 40 or so passengers to arrive. Unfortunately due to the flight delay our baggage wasn't transferred in time so once we arrived in New Orleans we had to go to the desk and submit a baggage ticket. The women at the desk were patient even though I was about to lose my mind! They located our luggage on the next flight and promptly brought it our hotel and they gave us an airport meal voucher and 2 drink vouchers even though we decided not to wait. The trip back home was just a pleasant and our luggage arrived with us. I will be flying again in 2 weeks and again over the summer on Southwest. I like the reasonable fares and the free baggage but the excellent customer service shown by Southwest will keep me a loyal customer.

Every half hour Southwest Airlines change the estimate on when we can go, without telling the truth about what's wrong, stringing passengers along until the inevitable cancellation and overnight stay on the airport floor. I keep making the same mistake in booking flights with this airline-every trip this year has been delayed without cause to the point where it isn't safe to travel with Southwest if you need to arrive on time. Their planes are dirty, particularly the restrooms. I have learned to make sure I won't have to use them and after today's disgusting service I will now avoid the whole airline.

Southwest Airlines,1,Dianne Hart,30th December 2015,"This flight was set to depart about 9:20pm on Dec 28, from Orlando to Birmingham, the first delay was to 10:15 pm and came out about 6:05pm. So they knew they had a problem at 6pm. It appears the problem originated due to the St Louis flight not being able to come into Chicago due to sleet and severe weather, hence the Chicago to Nashville leg of the flight was also delayed. The flight we were scheduled for was to come in from Nashville. Southwest is a point to point airline as I was told by customer service today, (after holding for 90 minutes) which means if a previous leg is delayed or canceled there is no plane to pick you up. So know where your plane is coming from and check its flight status. We were told another plane was being routed from Dallas to Nashville to pick up passengers and come to Orlando to be our plane from Orlando to Birmingham. The delay was again changed from 10:15 to 11:55 then to 12:55 am. A plane did arrive at 12:20 and we were told it was our flight. Only to be told at 12:50 am that the pilot has too many hours and cant fly you to Birmingham after all, so we are now at 12:50 am going to officially cancel the 9:20 pm Flight and we cant get you on another flight till 9:20 pm the next day. My concern in calling customer service was to ask that the process be reviewed in regard to how this flight delay then cancelation was handled as obviously a mistake was made in telling the passengers they had a plane coming with a delayed departure time set for 12:55 am and yet no one in command for Southwest was checking flight hours for the pilots to realize there was no way this flight was leaving Orlando. The customer service rep said she could only report my concerns to management but I did not have the right to ask for an explanation or any admission they had made an error in judgement on when the flight should have been canceled. I just wanted to know they would look into it and determine a better method to communicate flights, delays and pilot and crew travel restrictions so that this type of very avoidable error doesnt happen agsain. Southwest cannot control the weather and they will continue to be a point to point airline operation but get some people who can do math to determine flight hours limitations for pilots and crews in these situations so after a 4.5 hour delay you are not told the flight now has to cancel because of pilot has to many hours to fly. If you are making these types of errors what else is happening behind the scenes? Also I would just like an email from management that they are looking into this for enhancement or correction and wa stold no way your getting any admission from us about why this happened. Does not make me want to continue my long tenure with Southwest.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

They can't even get their automated phone service for checking flight status right or update their website in a timely manner. When a flight is cancelled it shouldn't take over 30 minutes for this stuff to be updated! Customers are trying to double check before they leave for the airport. Then when talking to a customer service representative they are rude and tell you it's out of their control when things are updated.

Southwest Airlines,9,Luca Wiley,16th December 2015,"My trip from Phoenix to Chicago this summer aboard Southwest was a 9/10 overall. As soon as we arrived at the airport, we used the check-in next to the parking garage. It was efficient and saved lots of time. At our gate, boarding was in groups. We were in B. We boarded with no trouble. Our plane was a 737-800, with the split scimitar winglets. I loved the plane, and it offered a smooth as can be ride. Beverage service was provided with small cups, but enough to quench my thirst. As usual, Southwest provided peanuts and pretzels. The last time I flew (2013) I was provided 2 bags of pretzels, but this flight I was given crackers and peanuts. The legroom on board was pretty acceptable, normal for a Southwest flight. The landing was the worst part, though. We had to go around to make way for a smaller plane, and as soon as we landed, it was the bumpiest I had experienced. Not that all airplane landings are smooth, but this one wasn't. The de-boarding process was quick. Due to the small traffic and flow of flights, Southwest's baggage claim was also a quick and easy experience.","Aircraft Boeing 737-800

In 1981, before they had Early Bird check in, I flew to Tampa to visit my parents with my 3 year old. There were NO adjoining seats. The only way I got a person to move was to say they would have to take care of my daughter. I quit flying SW! I started back when they started Early Bird. I am quitting SW again. It is truly a cattle car. Like riding the bus in the 60-70's. Both flights I was 49 with paying extra. I got the last aisle seat on that plane. Early bird does not help if you have a continuing flight which most Southwest Airlines flights are. Also too bare bones. Plane was freezing. No blankets. People were rude while waiting for the bathroom. Said don't stand here. Like where are you going to stand? It is not the airline I knew in the 70's. Even with 2 bags free it is not worth it and sometimes Southwest Airlines is more $$$. Apparently I was dozing on both flights and received no snacks or drinks.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,9,Eric Becker,5th December 2015,"We had a wonderful flight from Phoenix to Milwaukee. Left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. For us, Southwest is always on time. The flight attendants were very entertaining and worked with precision. This was a nonstop to MKE. Here is the negative, my wife and I paid the $12.50 each for Early Check-in and got positions A-36/37. It didn't mean much. Unfortunately, when they pre-boarded the plane, 33 people got on. About 10 to 12 wheelchairs and their entourage including a puny ""service"" dog. Even the gate agent rolled her eyes at the numbers. So, to sit together on the aisle, we were back in row 19. I can understand wheelchairs pre-boarding. Perhaps people in the entourage who pre-board should have to pay $12.50 each as well.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Southwest Airlines,8,Tammy Barton,2nd December 2015,"Husband and I flew Southwest Airlines for our 25 Wedding Anniversary Trip from Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles, California round-trip November 13, 2015 with return November 22, 2015. Both legs of the trip were wonderful. We did upgrade to the Early Bird Check-in and that was only $12.50 more each way per person. We got an A boarding position and had our pick of seats upon entering the aircraft. Both planes were on time and actually got us to our destinations earlier than scheduled. Flight attendance were nice and efficient and pilot was well spoken and friendly when he spoke to the plane about weather, arrival times and such. Seats were very tight, but that was to be expected. Both my husband and I took aisle seats and that makes for easier exiting to bathrooms and such. When we found that the cabin was a little too warm they fixed it right away making the temperature much more agreeable. Snacks were good and coffee was very good! No charge for those on Southwest. Being able to check two bags for no-charge was also nice. I will fly Southwest again and would recommend it to friends and family. Not the big open spaces that you get on some of the more expensive carriers, but a nice, low-key flight that gets you to where you want to go without cleaning out your wallet.","Aircraft Boeing 737

I thought a riot was about to start. I paid for the early seating and I was the last person on the plane because I would not push with the crowd. As I entered the plane last I told the flight attendant I was to be the 76th passenger to board and instead I was the last which separated me and my husband (on our anniversary) and her only comment was ""I wonder how that happened?"" I showed up 3 hours in advance to the airport and 6 other people showed up after we started boarding the bus ride to the tarmac and somehow they ended up ahead of me and seated together!

Not that it mattered since the return flight was delayed past the time our connecting flight flew out. They ended up putting us up in a Holiday Inn but we had to pay for a cab back to the airport since the flight we were booked on was too early for shuttle service.

Now when I am ready to book a flight the prices are horrendous. $800 to $900 to fly to Florida from Hartford. It is unbelievable. The times are terrible. I can't imagine what happened to this wonderful airline. There are hardly any flights. Keeps saying unavailable or sold out. I went on the web site exactly 1 minute after they opened their site and that is what it said, sold out, that is impossible. Usually their flights are $300 to $400 for that trip, so what happened?

Southwest Airlines,7,Jaret Rapp,11th November 2015,"Flying out of Las Vegas is often a depressing experience. The airport can be full gamblers who lost, or people sad to see their vacations end. The security line and line for the ticket counters can be infinite. On my flight, there was a gate change about 20 minutes before our flight was to board. This wasn't announced until shortly after we were supposed to board. There was some additional delay in boarding and our flight left about 30 minutes late. On Southwest, there are no assigned seats. I elected for $12 for the advanced check in option, and was assigned slot B5 (which is equivalent to the 65th person to board the aircraft). I had no problem finding a seat I liked, window seat near the front of the plane. There was wifi with about 20 live TV channels available on your own device. One thing I like about Southwest is they do not take themselves that seriously. Humor and a laid back attitude is common among ground staff and flight crew. The crew on my flight were attentive and friendly. Southwest also does not charge a bag or change fee. I booked the lowest fare and my fare went down a few times. I was simply able to change my flight to the current fare and a credit is now in my account to use towards future flights. I do not get my money back per say, but I do not lose it either. Try that with any other airline these days. And they still serve snacks.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

All over the airport was reviewing publicity posters which says “Transfarency” by Southwest Airlines which I’m aren’t sure how would that define without providing a minimal customer gratification, which not everyone thinks that money might be the only criteria to check. I’ve been associated with Southwest since long time, but haven’t felt this way where I had to lost valuable time with repeated change/delay in time. Further I was nowhere in a choice but had to wait for hours and hours. At time there were situation with my company where I had backed Southwest for its remarkable service in-spite of contradicting opinions all over. I made all my personal and business trips through this airline but eventually had end up in a situation of bizarre. Expected arrival of journey was 9 p.m and travel home on a emergency, and could't make it because of an undefined delay, In fact I had to drive 9 hrs by road to reach on time, and on return again had faced delay, however I understand weather issues. Nevertheless, such and incident will definitely leave an impression to surf for alternatives.","Type Of Traveller Business

We weren't the only ones that happened to (my partner's seat mates were complaining of it too, mind you they got on early enough to sit together, we didnt). If you don't board early you're stuck with middle seats and grumpy people who don't want you to sit there. One lady in first row piled snacks and drinks in seat beside her. She got away with it. People weren't sure if she was saving the seat. She wasn't. Great airline for rude selfish people, but if you're timid or shy, any other airline will do.

Southwest Airlines,3,John Schneider,24th October 2015,"Los Angeles to Baltimore Washington. Be warned about Southwest Airlines Early Bird check in feature. It has failed to work for me several times now. Your are required to pay an advance fee, which is supposed to get you a check in spot prior to the 24 hour advance check in. Instead, when checking in after the 24 hour time frame, you are assigned the next boarding place, which by then is far back in line. Better to just skip the fee and log in exactly 24 hours ahead, which we all know is a real pain. And if you try to get customer service to respond, be prepared for a 20 min hold on the phone, followed by a representative who could not care less. Southwest is fast succumbing to the fee-for-everything model, which in addition to their escalating prices, makes them just another airline with lousy service.

On flight out, the steward on their flight went out of their way to walk the two to their next gate (Baltimore) even though they did not need to. Great customer service! But to top that, when getting ready to return home, the little one was sick the morning of the flight. We were not sure if he would be able to fly. So we called (knowing that we would be charged to change their flight, and probably a lot) to change departure date and time. When explaining why I was calling, I was told I could change the flight and pay the difference. I decided to give the little one some time and the decide. Needless to say, time made no difference. I called back and talked to a Supervisor who answered the call. She quickly told me due to a child's sickness, we could change at no cost. We checked flights and changed to two days later.

Southwest Airlines,1,M Trankina,17th October 2015,"Southwest Airlines system apparently hacked on 10/11/15 forcing use of paper carbon boarding passes for entire family. Subsequently, my son who was returning to college the following week was unable to check in for boarding pass since they believed he had not flown the previous week. They wanted $200 more than was quoted on their website during ticketing to get on. My wife spent over 2 hours, including 45 min with a supervisor to no effect. Their response was to call customer relations on Monday morning which is 24 hours after the necessary flight. The bottom line is do not trust or rely on the Southwest Airlines website - it clearly is not accurate and do not expect anyone at Southwest to rectify a situation caused by their incompetence. We have used Southwest Airlines 15-30 times per year for the last 8 years. It appears we will have to return to Delta which offers the same flight for us and they appear to be improving compared to Southwest Airlines which seems to be in serious decline.","Aircraft Boeing 737

But not knowing when the plane will get to the destination just doesn't cut it. Lateness and cancellations galore. On the plus side, they still have the best luggage and change policy but it's now being trumped by the deficits. Often their prices range from the best to the worst on scheduled routes.

Southwest Airlines,1,T Thomas,8th October 2015,"We are at Dallas Love Field right now waiting on a flight that Southwest Airlines delayed because it was not full, and thus not profitable enough for management (flight 29). So we will miss our connecting flight to Harlingen from Houston. SWA says they have ""protected"" us by putting us on the 6:00PM flight instead. Then, the gate agent said that they ""tried to put us an an earlier flight but we must have not checked in early enough."" Not true. We were here before the recommended check in time. They are dishonest. Never fly SWA.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Southwest Airlines,10,Arik Katzenberg,8th October 2015,"Ft Lauderdale to Los Angeles via Atlanta with Southwest Airlines. Cross-country flights are always hard. But, I'd like to extend my appreciation to the Southwest flight crew who, with their freewheeling, fun sense of professionalism, managed to dissipate the stress I was feeling caused by the TSA. The flights are almost always full, and the seats are much smaller than at Delta, but the people at Southwest are really great. I'll certainly book again with Southwest.","Aircraft Boeing 737-800

Southwest Airlines,2,Adam Oliveira,30th September 2015,"Not only did I have to pay over 150 dollars to reschedule my Southwest Airlines flight for 4 hours later, which was the flight I originally wanted. I was told that if I had just shown up late to the airport they could have changed my flight for free. Apparently being nice and calling doesn't pay off. I ended up having to pay almost the original price of the round trip ticket again to get home. They informed me there was nothing they could do even though the whole thing was their fault. Once on the flight my row was skipped over for drinks and snacks. That is understandable, it happens. However, I paid for wifi that never worked.","Type Of Traveller Solo Leisure

Southwest Airlines,1,S Lusk,18th September 2015,"We arrived at Ontario Airport approximately 1 hour before the Southwest Airlines flight was due to depart. Our flight was supposed to depart at 1020 hours with a layover in Sacramento and then landing in Portland, Oregon at 1345 hours. At 0950 hours there was an announcement that the flight would be delayed until 1130 hours. This meant that we would not make it to Sacramento on time for our layover in Portland. We went to the Southwest counter and we were told that the only flight we could get on would mean we would have a four hour layover in San Jose and we wouldn't land in Portland until 1915 hours. I explained to the lady that we needed an earlier flight because we were flying to Portland for a family event that started at 1900 hours. She then told me that there was a flight that landed in Portland at 1805 hours, but that was the earliest. So, we reluctantly took that flight. My Fiancee asked about our luggage. She said that our luggage would be on a direct flight and would land in Portland at 1400 hours. I asked her since the luggage was getting there before us where we would pick it up. She said ""Baggage claim"". I understand where baggage is picked up, I'm not an idiot. I just thought since luggage was getting there sooner we would pick it up in a specific area at baggage claim. She handed me the tickets and told me that was it. I had overheard another customer received vouchers so I asked her if we would receive any vouchers for our trouble. She explained that we did not qualify for any vouchers because our flight landed before 1900 hours. We walked away from that counter upset, and promising we would never fly Southwest Airlines again. Deciding that we needed to do something about the lack of customer service, we got back in line to talk to someone else. When we eventually got to the front of the line we spoke to an agent. He explained to us that the flight we had was the earliest he could find for us. My fiancée then explained that we had not received a voucher or anything for our inconvenience. He then gave us two $200 vouchers for future use. We were still upset, but felt a little better about receiving the vouchers. While we were standing near the counter deciding where to go sit down, we overheard another gentleman being very loud and rude to one of the ladies behind the counter. He was on the same flight as us and was upset about not landing in Portland until late at night. Not only did he get on the same flight as we did, but he also received two $200 vouchers and face value for his ticket. I am sure that delays happen often do to inclement weather or maintenance problems and I understand that those problems are out of Southwest Airlines control. It is just very upsetting that someone that was rude and loud received more for his inconvenience than we did. Did we receive less because we were nice? Getting something for a flight being delayed shouldn't depend on the volume of our voice or the rudeness in our tone. This should be about what Southwest Airlines can do to keep customers and what they can do to apologize for missed family events. I am not only upset at the way we were treated, but also the fact that we received almost nothing for the extra seven hours we had to spend at the airport.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,Len Kaminski,17th September 2015,"I commend Southwest Airlines on the exceptional customer service I experienced today. Southwest Airlines actually contacted me by phone regarding an upcoming trip in January from San Juan to Canton /Akron. The flight was moved from the early afternoon to 6:45 am. That would present little issue except that we are arriving in to San Juan on a cruise ship at 8:00 am. and could not make the flight. The representative checked and there were no flights out to CAK the next two days and asked if we could switch airports. We advised that we lived near the CLE airport and they were more than happy to switch for us as long as we were willing to leave from one airport and arrive back at the other. A day later, after discussions with our traveling companions, we decided that it would make more logistical sense to leave from the same airport. I called Customer Service and they could not have made it easier for me and were more than willing to accommodate our request. Once again, this kind of service is the reason we keep coming back to Southwest Airlines.","Type Of Traveller Couple Leisure

Southwest Airlines,4,K O'Connor,15th September 2015,"For the most part, the experience was average. Except, there were a few specific instances in which I was extremely frustrated. 1) There was a delay in our flight (this happens), so we landed as soon as our connecting flight was finishing boarding. We stepped off the first plane (from Las Vegas to Austin), ran to the next gate for the next flight (Austin to DC), and as we arrived they were saying our names over the loudspeaker. We got on the flight and the plane was completely full except for our seats which was fine, however the flight attendants were not very kind, and we all felt that we were blamed for being late. However we have zero control in the matter of the other plane making it to the airport in time for the connecting flight. That was very unsettling, and embarrassing, as this was taking place in front of other passengers. 2) I attempted to connect to the WiFi via Southwest for their entertainment. This is free (yet limited) and there was no warning about that. The connection was also poor, so I decided to spend the $8 on the full-access WiFi. It took me over an hour to connect to this, and I needed certain applications on my phone to watch certain shows which I could set-up until after the flight. Again, there was no warning prior to purchasing that additional applications would be needed. Additionally, the connection was poor and I had to constantly refresh (even after paying), which was extremely frustrating. Generally, very limited legroom, and too long of a time getting snacks/refreshments, but I guess you get what you pay for.","Aircraft Boeing 737

They put me on the next flight in the morning at no extra charge. The flight attendants were very professional and courteous, and some very funny. The drinks are reasonably priced also. When I got to Cleveland, I got all the way to the baggage return, picked up my bag, waited outside for 10 minutes for my ride, and then realized I didn't have my wallet. I of course go racing back inside and find the first Southwest Airlines employee I can, because I am well beyond TSA checkpoints and can't get back to the gate.

Southwest Airlines,1,Tom Scheers,29th August 2015,"I will never fly Southwest again. If you have a flight that connects and leaves after 2pm you will more likely than not miss the connecting flight and be stranded overnight. They offer no assistance in that event regardless of if it was their fault or not and they will never put you on another airline. They offer frequent flights between LAX and SF Bay Area making it popular with business travelers. The problem is that they routinely cancel flights 20 minutes before departure because the flight is less than half full and then send you on a later flight 2 or 3 hours later making it impossible to schedule and attend meetings the same day. Southwest went from the very best no frills airline 10 years ago to one of the top 10 worst now. I wouldn't use any airline now unless they are a direct flight. For LAX to SF Area use Jet Blue, Virgin America or Alaska Airlines, not Southwest.","Aircraft Boeing 737

I had to make an international flight in Seattle and I had no trouble at all. The reason why they have open seating is to speed up the boarding process. And yes they do pack a lot of people into planes because they do such a good job! The attendants are really wonderful about 95% of the time.

I got a text every 3 to five minutes with multiple changes in departure time. Times moving forward and back ranging 2 hrs back to 30 min delay. The plane boarded 3 times before they actually departed. The flight itself was 20 min longer than it was supposed to be. The connecting flight departed 10 min before we landed. They tell me that this is common and they don't compensate for this situation. I will pay for extra bags and assigned seating, because I will fly with an airline that care about their customers instead of putting on a front with fancy advertising.

Southwest Airlines,3,Tanya Shannon,16th August 2015,"First time traveling with Southwest to PUJ from IAD. On August 15, 2015 I traveled from PUJ to MDW. Before departing the airplane, the pilot informed passengers that all flights to Washington were cancelled and to proceed to ticketing. So once I cleared customs, I went upstairs to the ticketing counter and after spending almost an hour in line, I was told my flight to IAD had been cleared. It was around 4:15pm. So they took my baggage and told me to proceed to the gate. I had to go through security again. After spending over 3 hours at the gate, I was informed again the flight had been cancelled. Customer Service said that Southwest had only two flights to IAD on 8/16 and the flights were full and they could get me on a flight on Tuesday. I understand the issue with air traffic control, however FAA stated computers were back in service at 4 pm on 8/15. Southwest only had three to four flights to IAD and my flight was at 8:55 pm. So with only four flights, Southwest could not get the later flights to IAD out? I'm stuck in an airport on standby but the only thing Southwest say is sorry, it wasn't our fault. Southwest needs to do a better job with its flights and with IAD being a major airport, more flights to and from are needed. Southwest also need to branch out to ORD and contract with other airlines to assist in situations like this. Having customers wait for three days to catch another flight without any form of compensation is unacceptable. Offering free baggages and open seating will not keep customers.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

Southwest Airlines,10,Nakidra Dobshinsky,4th August 2015,"I wanted to say Thank you and give super kudos to an employee who worked at the Southwest ticket counter in Atlanta. I never write a review but this was a experience I had to share regarding flight #860 leaving ATL going to SFO. My boyfriend and I fly Southwest all the time, he is usually on a companion pass and I'm usually a reserved ticket. Very few times we've run into overbooked flights and missed connections. I noticed when ever we do hit these bumps in our travel the person at the ticket counter treats his situation totally different from mine. Makes one think - does the type of ticket a traveler has warrant the type of service he/she receives during these traveling hiccups? Any issues I have with my reserved ticket are handled promptly and with a pleasant demeanor. This particular time I was not traveling with my boyfriend and there was a hiccup with the flight. I purposely stayed on the phone while he went from Southwest Airlines employee to employee and every person was rude, and flat out didn't give the type customer service you would expect from one of the most respected airlines. Being at the Atlanta airport from 8:00 am till 4:00 pm and having no luck getting back to San Francisco, I'm sure he was ready to give up. Good thing we held on a little while longer. The ticket agent seemed to not care what type of ticket he had. Her main concern was making sure the customer ended up where he needed to be. Thank you 1,000 times over. I wish I could have been there to speak with someone on the spot. I only wish that the employees at the ticket counter treated all customers the same and handled their flight hiccups with the utmost professionalism no matter how stressed out they may be and no matter if it's a buddy pass, companion pass or reserved ticket. Thank you again.","Type Of Traveller Business

Check in at BOS was efficient and the attendants were friendly. I opted to purchase the ""early bird check in"" and was slotted at A53. The aircraft was nice and clean. The FAs were friendly, and were helpful. The flight left on time, and actually landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I had no problem finding a seat that I liked. Based on this one experience, I would recommend and fly WN again.","Aircraft Boeing 737

Southwest Airlines,1,Terry Booth,21st July 2015,"On a recent flight originating from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Richmond, connecting in Atlanta, the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either. We took the flight to BWI, and had to get a rental at 2.00 am. Arriving home at 5.00 am, and with a extreme distaste for the way Southwest treats their paying customers, we decided never to use this carrier again.","Aircraft Boeing 737-700

Southwest Airlines,8,Carol Joseloff,8th July 2015,"Traveled with spouse, daughter-in-law, and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags. If the airline would support their seating and baggage policies all passengers would be much less aggravated.","Type Of Traveller Family Leisure

There were two people transferring from my connecting flight from Baltimore to Columbus. Two, would you think that they would have the luggage at an easy to reach area. Now, can't always blame the airlines for this. Lost luggage happens. However, the reason behind my lost luggage was outrageous. After landing 15 minutes early of the scheduled landing time, my flight waited for an hour on the runway. Almost missed the last connecting flight to Columbus. When announced the terminals, they also noted that Southwest is not responsible for your missed flight, if you do miss it. My flight left at 10.10, I boarded at 10. I enjoy Southwest but unfortunately my last couple of times flying with them have been miserable. The other time, I was at the airport for 10 hours waiting on their planes, because they were delayed in the schedule.

Return legs were problematic as there was a line of severe thunderstorms over Baltimore causing severe scheduling problems for one of the major hubs for Southwest. Southwest came through and got us back to Providence, albeit two hours late. The terminal monitors in Detroit kept us well informed of delays and the Southwest app (although a bit slow in updating) did also. For the people who complain about the boarding methodology of Southwest, it is a bit strange for the uninitiated, but it works and has worked successfully for many years. If you insist on assigned seating, don’t fly Southwest - simple as that. It is an airline that admittedly has its foibles, but even with that it is still an excellent product! .","Aircraft Boeing 737

After waiting an hour on the runway we were unable to take off due to a storm that was off in the distance (not a big deal if they were on time however it was their fault for being late and getting caught in the storm).

Many seem to be surprised at SW boarding procedures can't say I love it but at least I understand it. I paid the twelve dollars for a seating upgrade got A-37 out and A-43 back. Got on with plenty of seats and overhead space. If you don't like the charge go on another airline and pay $30+ to check your bag. The trip was fine but airline travel anymore is like bus travel used to be don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed or pay 5 times as much and go first class on another airline. I'm no spring chicken 70 years old and the seats are not great but again it's a bus not an airliner. I did fine would fly SW again if they had the best price and routing I always check around.

Southwest Airlines,6,R Shaffer,17th April 2015,I flew SWA from Tampa to Baltimore in April. It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable.

I pay the extra money so I can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the Port side of the plane in order to quickly un-board either for another connection flight or to get on the road. My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,M Pratten,17th March 2015,The worst airline I have flown. San Diego to Vegas Friday 13th Feb. At check-in told there is no allocated seating. Nowhere to sit in departure lounge hardly anywhere to stand. We were in one of the last groups to board as we moved into the line the girl handling boarding called us to the front to tell my daughter who is pregnant that she was allowed priority boarding as she is classed as disabled being pregnant. We accepted it and boarded sat at the rear of the cabin but luckily sitting together no room in overhead lockers so glad we had checked bag in. Never come across such an untidy cabin crew. Turned down the offer of a drink and was shocked they serve peanuts must be one of the few airlines that still do. Return flight on the 15th played the pregnant card for all it was worth boarded first row one seat locker for baggage no improvement in cabin crew. It was a once only flight with them we are spoiled in Australia with our airlines who get it right most of the time.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,2,Sidyelyeva Galyna,24th February 2015,Traveled with Southwest for the first and definitely last time. They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits. But low-cost savings are not actually saving you anything when situations like that happens and they are not worth it. Not flying with Southwest anymore. Do not recommend.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,4,G Taylor,18th February 2015,"Tampa FL to Phoenix AZ on 2/5. Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option. Evaluation: do not spend the extra $25 - it is a total waste of money.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

Purchased early bird check-in in a bid to protect a better boarding position (and overhead bin space). Was assigned mid-A group so did get the seat location and bin space I was after. The entire boarding process is just a bit too odd for my liking with numbered posts and suspicious-looking 'post squatters.' I didn't need a calculator to know there were some queue jumpers at least within the 'A' group. Seating is just ok I thought the pitch was a bit tighter than the 32"" advertised and while I got the seat location I wanted I ended up with a group 'C' middle-seat'r who felt entitled to both armrests and wasn't exactly on the lean side. The in-flight service was fine the aircraft new and bright the flight crew fairly amenable and the flight left and arrived on time. Just can't get past the boarding system though.

Southwest Airlines,10,A LeClair,21st January 2015,"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

This plane ride from John Wayne Airport to Houston was miserable the free seating is probably the worst idea ever. To make it worse they don't care about your boarding pass order I got on the same as a C31 when I was a B1. The plane is so cramped I could not even put my tray down without it being on my knees. The flight had no delays although for comfort I would take a delay. The ""free"" wifi is a marketing scheme they actually charge you 8 dollars and you are extremely limited on what you can do. This was a round-trip both times family and friends were trying to save seats. This is supposed to be first come first serve - I did not get to sit with the person I traveled with.

We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. They never announced when we were going to start boarding. And once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be.

I took a flight from Cleveland to Love Field #4221 October 11 2014. It took one hour from the time our flight landed until the bags were delivered. One hour I could not believe it. They build that nice building but have no way of telling passages which of the four baggage carousels your bags will be delivered on so people scurry from one to another looking. Even after the bags arrive the Southwest team member usually is to busy to announce baggage drop until 4 or 5 bags have arrived. You spent a lot of money to rebuild that airport you would think that you could make the bags arrive in 20 or less minutes.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

When we arrived at the airport the flight was delayed due to mechanical failure for 2 hours. Original posted delay turned into multiple delays promised another plane which didn't show when expected. 8 hours later we were still waiting. Our patience as well as the entire waiting crowd was gone. The staff at the gate were authorized to reimburse passengers with certificate travel for the inconvenience. Ok great (we thought). I have tried to use our certificates in several different ways. 1) We had already purchased tickets for a trip later in the summer (same airline) asked if we could cancel those and use the certificates NO. 2) Asked if we could use the certificates for additional family members to travel with us NO. 3) Tried to book a flight for another trip sorry certificate seats sold out. 4) Tried to book again on a different date NO because that put us past the travel dates on the certificate. 5) Last try today and told that the certificates are expired and no longer valid. What does a person have to do to use certificate travel? Travel to destinations nobody wants to go on dates no one wants to travel? If a certificate travel is given as a gesture of good will for inconveniences endured due to airline failure shouldn't the recipient be able to use at their convenience not the airlines?,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,S Hertz,24th September 2014,"I paid for the early bird check in as I do on most of my flights. I checked in online the day before at 3.30pm which is 5 hours after I needed to if I didn't pay for the earlybird check in. When I check-in I was given A31 and A32 but didn't print my boarding pass as I didn't have access to a printer. The next morning before my flight I printed my boarding pass and was given B32 and B33. When I got to the gate I asked the front desk women at the gate what was going on. She said ""we don't guarantee what number you get."" I told her that I checked in and received A31/32 and she told me again. ""We don't guarantee the numbers."" I told her that this was a rip-off and that if I wasn't traveling with another family I probably wouldn't have made a big deal but since they also checked the same time I did and they received B28/29/30 and didn't pay for the earlybird that something was wrong. She told me that there is nothing she can do and I'd have to write Southwest for a reply. She looked things up on her computer and said that the earlybird for this flight never went through on my flight back. I will be looking for other airlines for my flights for now on.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,1,H Deaton,19th September 2014,"Live near BWI one of SW biggest hubs. Use SW for short non-stops but even those are becoming intolerable. Flight attendants show up after boarding time. Apparently unconcerned that delay 150 or so people so they can have 10 more minutes to do whatever. Rude instructions when boarding. Told to put my bag in bin down the aisle despite having space above my seat ""to save room for other bags"" unbelievably stupid as I have to go against traffic to retrieve bag now. They've gone from a ""cattle car"" (based on their Southwest origins) to a chicken coop.

Southwest Airlines,4,B Spainhour,19th September 2014,"I was a loyal Southwest customer who hadn't flown in a while. After five flights within the same week all I can say is Southwest isn't what it used to be. For a 6'5"" 200 lb person the new seats are sheer torture. And on every flight I encountered too many passengers being crammed in to too-small planes. It's no surprise that every logistic being run on such a razor's edge makes for a stressful experience. God help you if you have to endure any connecting flights. The schedules are so tight now that they have no time to even clean the planes between boardings and there are lots of delays. What a terrible atmosphere we encountered. The staff tries their best to pretend they aren't running a grim cattle drive but no one is fooled. I guess corporate has decided to maximize volume and profits over any considerations of passenger comfort. Too bad. Southwest used to be different from the sleazy mentalities running most other airlines.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

That's why the first time there was mechanical delay we didn't let that impact our view of the airlines. Then in the same week we had another mechanical delay. Now don't get me wrong I would much rather them find out problems while the aircraft is still on the ground! Today ( all delays have been within the same week and half) there is another mechanical delay! This makes three in a short time span. What's going on with Southwest airlines aircraft? As I said before I would rather find problems on the ground but three delays on three different aircraft's all mechanical issues is reason for concern! It turns out a mechanic accidentally opened up the bathroom sewage and it poured out into the aisle of the plane. No one is getting on that plane anytime soon!","Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,2,Scott Palmieri,17th September 2014,"I will never fly Southwest again. They claim there is no assigned seating but you can purchase ""Early Bird Check- in"" which they claim automatically checks you in 36 hours in advance instead of the usual 24 hours. So I purchased the Early Bird check in plan thinking that my whole family would be able to sit together. (Group A-so I thought). Surprise when I received my boarding passes we were in Group B which means you have less that a 50% chance of your family seating together. I called Southwest and was told that the Early Bird Check in does not guarantee anything it just gives you the best available boarding at that time Well they didn't tell me this when they took my money. So in order to ensure that my family would be together I had to spend more money and purchase First-In boarding passes (Group A) for an additional $40 per person (One way). The plane was small cramped no room to even think about being comfortable. I am an average size man (5'11 195 lbs). I can't imagine how someone bigger must have felt. Then imagine my surprise when the flight attendant announced to the final group of people boarding (Group C) to take the first available seat because they were saving the seats in the back for families so they could sit with their children. Twice I spent money to guarantee my family would sit together because they claim there is no assigned seating and now they are saving seats for families so they can sit together Are they serious!! Either you have assigned seating or you don't. Which is it? It is clear that Southwest doesn't have their act together and I believe they are not worth the hassle. I won't fly them again and certainly would not recommend them to anyone.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

I paid the $25 for my sister and I to do the early bird check-in which I will always do from now on. We boarded quickly and took off on time. I enjoyed sitting up front on the way to Phoenix (I'm claustrophobic so the extra room made for a more comfortable feeling overall). Coming back we were a few rows back and it was cramped for sure. That's to be expected on a smaller jet with smaller seats. For a domestic flight it's doable. What I was really impressed with was the overall attitude and presence of the crew. I have always flown Delta in the past and was surprised to see the pilots before the flight. The flight attendants were very nice. The flight back to Atlanta was interesting as there were weather issues but the pilot did a great job of navigating around and through the worst of it I believe as there was hardly any turbulence. I'll fly SW again for sure.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,4,E Hansen,14th September 2014,"I recently flew with Southwest. I was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system. Although I was aware that the Southwest boarding system was different I had no idea how poorly it could work in reality. Long story short: whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket. I needed to travel within the last few weeks from St Louis International airport to Washington Dulles International airport. I would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus. In order to get a better seat on the airplane I paid the extra money for a business select ticket. This puts you near the front if not at the front of the line. Southwest seating is first come first serve. On my way to D.C. the system worked well enough although on my first flight I did not get a great seat as I was boarding in position A15. That didn't bother me much the system had worked as designed. My second flight I was first in line and pretty content with the outcome. However on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating. The problem started when it was time to board after a layover at Midway airport in Chicago. Now I first want to say that I support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to pre-board. But I do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane. My ticket from Midway to St Louis had me boarding in position A1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for pre-boarding. There were four pre-board passengers ahead of me. When the gate agent called for pre-boarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them. Not acceptable. By the time I got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken. The four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members. Why can't Southwest declare the front row an ""exit row""? It is an exit row! That would prevent pre-boarders from sitting there. What did I pay extra for to get priority seating if Southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people? In the end: I paid and they did not deliver. I recommend that if you choose to fly Southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket. I personally will not be flying Southwest again under any circumstances.","Cabin Flown Business Class

They also offer free beverages and a small snack on board which is a nice gesture to get you through a short flight. There are a very efficient airline.

Upon boarding our experience was very positive with the attendant who seated us and helped with storing our carry-ons. We never saw that person again since she must have been working the back of the plane. The attendants in the front of the plane (a male and female) did their job and that was about it - bare minimum.

It is with trepidation that I fly other airlines as you never know what you are going to get-especially Delta. The customer service is second to none and the seats are always roomy and predictable. Unless you need the extra leg room such as an exit row if you check in at the 24 hour mark or pay the low fee to board early you have a large selection of seats. Rarely are they late. The staff are empowered to solve customer issues and do so readily. Airline tickets are easy to change and credit refund with no fees. Plus there is no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and their pricing is competitive. Airline miles are so easy to use including international. This airline develops trust based on their reliability and customer service. Definitely a loyal fan and steady customer!,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Staff must've taken how to not smile and treat everyone like cattle as part of their classes because on every flight we took (there were 4 total for the round trip) all attendants were almost disgruntled employees. They looked like they ""had"" to be there. An elderly woman who couldn't sit with her young grandchild who was very nervous about that (because of their no assigned seats policy) was delighted when another customer volunteered to switch seats with her before they even started the seat belt instructions and the first flight attendant reprimanded them and then I saw her tell the second attendant who rolled her eyes. Come on that made the flight more enjoyable for everyone plus what was the big deal to them? Our soft drinks took almost the whole flight to get to us and then they ask for your garbage right after you start drinking it. The seats are comfortable enough but there is no perks to paying the extra $12 a ticket for the early bird check in unless you are just partial to a window seat. I got A30-36 boarding most times which is after the first A group picks all the leg room seats. The only thing I like is that you can control whether or not you sit in front of kids if you don't want to you find a seat in front of adults already sitting.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

They canceled the flight with no prior warning and did nothing to help their passengers from being stranded in the airport. In fact the customer service representative was horrendous. When I called to try to fix the problem she not only had no sympathy for the stress they were causing their customers but she also laughed at me when I was voicing my concerns about the fact that the only flight she was offering us was for Wednesday and his original flight was for Monday. The only solution she had was either take the Wednesday flight and figure out a place to stay for 2 nights or they will refund our ticket price (not the fees included with the ticket) and we were tasked with finding another flight with a different airline to get home. Southwest has no issue with leaving their customers stranded in an airport with no alternative plan than to find your own way home.

Southwest Airlines,,A Roberts,17th July 2014,When and if Southwest changes its seating policy I will consider flying it again. Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest. I can fly into JFK pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a Southwest flight to ISP costs.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,B Kvanvig,13th July 2014,Our flight from Orlando to Denver was full. I checked in about 23 hours before departure and got group C boarding passes. They want you to buy the automatic check in so they can get extra money out of you. My wife and I had to sit about 6 rows apart. The return flight was delayed 1.5 hours and when we tried to switch to an earlier flight they wanted $347 to change so we waited. This flight we checked in for when we arrived at the airport and got group C again. Flight was full but we at least got seats across the aisle from each other. I'm done flying Southwest I would rather have assigned seating even if I have to pay a bit more. I don't know why the flight was delayed in Denver never got an explanation. Too many pre-boarders families etc. that your boarding pass doesn't really mean anything anyway.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,S Campbell,13th July 2014,SJC to PDX. I have never experienced such poor Customer Service in the 13 years I have been traveling with this airline. I have been getting the feeling that the service had lost its world renowned status for the last few years. I stayed with this airline for their frequency and on time performance. Despite having a huge incentive voucher from Alaska Airlines I will say that after this experience I have completely given up on Southwest Airlines as a competitor. I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. The chaos that ensued was unreal. Before I knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers. I opted to leave the airport and fly Alaska Airlines the next day.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,Martin Long,1st July 2014,My daughters were competing in Orlando Florida. My wife scheduled an 8.30 am flight 3 months ago to make sure to be there. Right after the passengers boarded the flight the pilot announced to passengers that there was a problem with the plane. The passengers deplaned and were told that SW was working on getting another plane a direct flight. There was no direct flight offered and after being told they would be leaving at 5 different times SW finally decided to bump the 3pm flight for the 8.30 am passengers. For all my wife's troubles she was given a measly $200 voucher. She could have driven from Dallas to Orlando faster than SW got her there.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,5,T Brandt,1st July 2014,"Southwest's Boarding Process has gotten completely out of control. I haven't flown on Southwest in about a year but my experience on a recent round-trip from Phoenix to Boston with connections proved repeatedly how flyers are abusing Southwest's boarding process. On the first leg I was assigned B38 since I did not pay for EarlyBird seating although I did check in exactly 24 hours before the flight. By the time they got to B31-60 practically the entire flight had boarded. At least 20 people were in the pre-board category about 5 A-list flyers who hadn't gotten an A number boarded after all the A's were called and then another 26 people boarded during ""families and children"". There were less than 30 people remaining to board the plane (which was entirely full) by the time they got to the B31-60 category - when technically there should have been 75-90 people left to board. This experience was repeated on all four flights and was worse when leaving BWI when a group of ""C"" pass holders snuck into the B segment and were not stopped by the gate agent. The final straw was the flight from Chicago to Phoenix. I watched a family walking through the airport to check-in at which point the parents asked for a wheelchair for their young daughter - who had been walking with them up to that point. A wheelchair was commandeered and they were expedited through the TSA check-point. Lo and behold when I arrived at my gate weren't they there - and with a pre-board pass. So clearly another way to bypass Southwest's procedures is just to commandeer a wheelchair and then you get to pre-board. It really is time for Southwest to just start assigning seats; the flying public it has been demonstrated will otherwise continue to outmanoeuvre and get around the ""rules.""","Cabin Flown Economy Class

We arrived at Pittsburgh Airport with our flight scheduled to leave at 6.30pm when checking in they said that our flight was delayed due to bad weather and offered to move us to a flight leaving at 4.45pm we agreed and actually made it in time to board. Once it was our turn to board we were told our boarding passes were not valid and had to get out of line to go back to the lady at the boarding counter to receive new boarding tickets. We finally boarded the plane and eventually made it to our first lay-over at Chicago Airport. Ended up waiting at this airport for almost 5 hrs for our plane to arrive. Yet again when trying to board we handed the lady our boarding passes and she scanned them and was told they were invalid. Again we had to get out of line and wait until we were cleared by whomever she called about the matter. After finally getting on the plane we waited an additional 20 minutes for a passenger who for some reason or another was late. Finally we landed at Memphis Airport at 11.15pm an hour behind schedule and thank goodness our rental car place was kind enough to wait 20+ minutes after they closed at 11pm so we could get our rental we had reserved. I was hoping our flight home would be less eventful not so lucky! We arrived at Memphis Airport and things went smoothly (I had high hopes after this) we arrived at Orlando FL airport. Once we arrived at Orlando airport things went downhill. We almost immediately found out that our 4.15 flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to ""weather"" and wouldn't be leaving until 6.45 pm. After trying to figure out a plan we called customer service at Southwest and was told that she didn't know why we were told that our flight was delayed due to weather in fact it had to make an emergency landing in Baltimore due to mechanical issues. 6 long hours later we finally took off around 7pm and arrived at Pittsburgh Airport 5 hrs behind schedule at 11.40pm.

Southwest Airlines,,Wesley Lewis,1st July 2014,"Today when I showed at the airport I was informed that my flight would be late and that I had to be re-routed. This change puts me at my destination airport approximately 3 hours later than my original ticket. My wife and children now have to pick me up well past their normal bed time (our children are young). Additionally my boarding number is well past what I had checked in with for my original flight (instead of early B I'm now late C). I now have to wait at my departure airport 4.5 hours instead of my planned 1.5 hours. This type of customer handling is unacceptable. Southwest Airlines is supposed to be one of the top tier airlines in regards to customer satisfaction however my treatment today was truly unexpected. I should have been upgraded to business class seating (A1-A15) at least at a discounted price. Instead I was offered nothing for my inconveniences as well as my family's. I truly understand that things happen outside of Southwest's control but I think some concession should have been offered. This would have made me feel better. Instead I feel like Southwest's attitude towards it's passengers/customers is ""deal with it"" with a smile and a nod and a ""next customer please"" attitude.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

But Southwest seems completely incapable of telling passengers what's going on or correcting a problem. I was then told the plane would leave at 11.15 then it's leaving at 12.15 am. Then it's leaving at 1.30 am. 2 am they let us on the plane and we wait for an hour. Pilot time has been used up so we have to wait for another pilot. We wait an hour. No pilot. Flight is canceled. I make reservations for a flight out that morning at 5.30. Get my ticket go to the gate. Cancelled. So where's the bag that I checked on the flight. They can't provide any answers. All they seem capable of telling me is that was an act of God and therefore they are not responsible for anything that happened. Yes it's cheap but that's no excuse for treating everyone like cattle.

This whole time the pre-board passengers were still on the plane with no air what-so-ever. After 15-20 minutes they boarded the rest of the passengers. They then told us that the AC wouldn't properly work because the engine was too hot so we all sat cramped in our seats sweating for the two hour flight. No moving air at all.

Southwest Airlines,3,L Mowen,16th June 2014,Today was my first time flying with Southwest Airlines and I must say that I am very disappointed. Our connection flight had to be rescheduled by Southwest and by how they scheduled it we had only 30 minutes to make our next flight which turned into 2 minutes when the initial flight was delayed by the airline. Needless to say we did not make our flight. What should have been a five hour travel day turned into an all day travel day which was very long and tiresome for me especially since I am eight months pregnant. It would have made the experience a lot better if Southwest would have somehow reimbursed us for some of the flight or offered us a discount for future flights since the delays were of no fault of our own. The flight attendants were nice and the people at the ticket counters were overall nice but overall the travel experience was very disappointing.

Always a fast paced bump to my shoulder as she walked past me in the other direction. Never once an ""excuse me"" or a turn around to see what she'd just hit.

My luggage was lost on my last trip from SMF-PDX I was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag (golf clubs) could would not be delivered to Bend OR where I was staying. The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight.

Southwest Airlines,6,S Maize,16th May 2014,"Something seems to have changed at Southwest. For many years SW was the only airline we wanted to fly because: on-time schedules nice staff/crew all around good operation. Recently (week of May 8-15 '14) my family experienced sub quality performance from SW (flights from Dallas and Albuquerque to Orlando and back). Schedules were way off hours late with inaccurate updates that basically said ""we'll fly when we fly"" (weather plays into this but weather has always been an issue and procedures to deal with it efficiently as in giving accurate information should be in place. Flying out of Orlando was a total fiasco. The flight schedule boards and the gate desk showed ""on-time"" departures when in fact the departure time had already passed. Travelers were asking each other for updates from the internet. Finally the flight number completely disappeared from all boards (the SW rep at the gate said after an hour flights are dropped and that he couldn't say when the flight would take off). So 3.5 hours later our plane takes off. Connecting flights of course didn't happen because our flights were at the end of the day. In Phoenix around midnight we were dumped with no customer service desk open to help those who missed their connections to re-schedule. We were lucky enough to find one ticket rep (Homero) who was trying to go home but did help single handedly even though the counter was closed and many people were needing assistance. SW offered no vouchers for future travel and we had to find our own accommodations for the night-the info handout with a number to call for a nearby hotel recommendation with discount had little to offer with no pick-up available. My conclusion is that perhaps SW has gotten too big (with Airtran acquisition) and has lost control of some operations. SW is at its best as a short haul regional airline. Cross country flights (3 hours +) are off schedule and uncomfortable. The good news is that the staff and crew we encountered tried to be helpful but they are powerless when they don't have the information and support that they need.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,10,Delane Thomas,16th May 2014,I have flown Southwest several times. This is my first time to write a review. We flew from Little Rock to Las Vegas. On the way back we were late to board and missed the flight. They put our luggage on another plane and couldn't guarantee when they would get to Little Rock. They put us on a flight to Chicago a little later every seat was full so we were lucky to get on. From Chicago we got a plane to Little Rock again the seats were full so we were lucky again. We were about five hours or so later than if we hadn't missed our original flight. All I can say the Southwest people were very nice about trying to help make the connections and when we got to Little Rock our luggage came in about forty-five minutes later. All I can say about Southwest is good. The flight attendants were very nice too all of them. When we came into Las Vegas the plane went over the Hoover Dam with a very good view I made a comment about the view when I got off and told the pilot I was hoping for a circle around the dam he told me they frowned on that since it would take about another thousand bucks. A little humor thrown in. When I fly it will be with Southwest I have never had any trouble.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,Wanda Cloutier,4th May 2014,This was the first and last time I plan to fly with Southwest/Transair. The plane was dirty and noisy. The staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. The internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen. It was a waste of ten dollars for a service that did not work. I am only 5 feet 2 but I could not even get my legs comfortable. There was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. When we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. I said goodbye and she barely looked up. The pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land. The only good part of the whole experience was the time of day was convenient but I can find that with any airline. I will definitely be going back to the airline I have been using for decades. That way I know what I will be getting for my money. Sorry but this one bad flight put a sour taste in my mouth and wallet.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,Robert Calhoun,3rd May 2014,Not very impressed. It's been my third time the flight has been delayed and I got a 15 minute heads up of course that update was completely useless as I was already being reassigned planes. Taking into consideration that nothing can be done about poor weather the boarding process is awful and the representatives at the Fort Lauderdale front desk seemed very inconvenienced that they had to re-book us.

During a short period of relatively smooth air the crew started taking drink orders. Fortunately on the way home the crew were very pleasant with passengers. The plane was a 737-700 fairly comfortable and the free snacks were a nice surprise.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,3,Bill Riley,30th April 2014,I think the boarding process with un-assigned seats is outdated and treats folks like cattle. You have no clue if you will be sitting with the person you are traveling with. On the first flight I had a great seating number had to be re-routed due to plane problems and was near-last on the re-routed flight. Sat in the middle seat (without my travel partner) for four hours. On the way back I checked in 20 hours in advance and was the very last person boarding. How is it that I can check in that early and every single person be seated ahead of me? Again sat in the middle and without my travel partner. The upgrade offer is nothing more than a bribe. I won't fly Southwest again.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,2,James Moninger,16th April 2014,I have avoided using Southwest in the past as I don't like lines pushing and shoving or unassigned seating. Nonetheless after hearing about SWA's Business Select Class I decided to give them a try. For about $60 more than the walk-up fare Business Select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the A1-A15 group thus being among the first to board. I was thrilled when I checked in online and received boarding pass A-1. The gate room seemed fairly empty and Southwest agents were hawking upgrades for $40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line. Upon boarding the aircraft I discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane. Little overhead space available and mostly middle seats. Although the staff was affable and tried their best I found this to be an extremely uncomfortable way to travel and recommend strongly against wasting money for Business Select.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

That is 1) assigned seats and 2) boarding by zones. I can't understand why the general flying public tolerates Southwest's cattle call boarding.

Southwest Airlines,1,Dolby John,13th March 2014,Vacation to Cabo San Lucas Mexico scheduled 3/1/14. Boarded in Milwaukee with a connection in Denver. When we arrived at check in we were told the flight had been 'overbooked' by 5 passengers. We received the last 2 boarding passes luckily. Upon being seated and waiting for 15 minutes the flight attendant announced that the plane was over-weight and 8 passengers would have to leave. It took another 30 minutes to adjust the weight before we took off - 1 hour after schedule. Upon arriving in Denver an hour late we had to rush to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Cabo. Flight to Cabo went on schedule until standing at the luggage carousel our 2 pieces of checked luggage never came out. It was not until 30 hours later that our luggage finally showed up. On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee. Once through customs you need to claim your luggage and then recheck it with Southwest/AirTran. We then had to pass through security before racing to another terminal where our gate was located because of late arrival. We boarded the plane and left for Milwaukee arriving at 10pm on-time. We then went to retrieve our luggage and once again our two bags never showed up. It took another 36 hours to get our bags delivered to our home.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Before I even left LAX I knew my flight home from SFO would be over 1.5 hours late. That allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight. I did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to LAX. Even though I used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight. Flights always have drink service and a choice of peanuts/pretzels. Even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite. In addition I always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time - nice touch. So while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service.

Southwest Airlines,1,D Burton,4th December 2013,I have been on several airlines in my life but Southwest Airlines in my opinion is the worst. The open seating is like a mad zoo. No control people pushing it is the worse possible way I have ever seen to board a plane. Additionally the seats are the smallest and most cramped I've been in. No leg room and a totally miserable experience. I will not fly with them anymore. They have lost me as a customer. However the flight crew is friendly.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,A Morgan,29th November 2013,I have been a Southwest customer for years and have rarely had problems. Today I was trying to get home for Thanksgiving. I have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine. Until today I have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate. Today I received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 5.25pm until 6.00pm and then of a further delay until 6.20pm. When I arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving. I moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so I could sit and elevate my feet. I was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 6.20pm. At 6.10 I got up and walked down to my gate. When I arrived I discovered that the plane had actually departed at 5.50 before I received the second text. When I spoke with the person at the Customer Service desk I was told that I should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where I had been sitting. When I asked why I had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left I was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only. I was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts. I was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to Baltimore for a layover then fly to Nashville and arrive at my destination a little before mid-night or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning. I could not face several more hours of great discomfort so I am spending tonight in the Microtel without luggage or medication.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,7,M Kobayashi,10th November 2013,I fly with Southwest Airlines frequently. In fact I hardly ever fly with any other US carrier. This does not mean that I love the airline merely that by US standards it is not bad. Some flights go well and the crew are a lot of fun. This was especially the case on both flights I took on 28 October from San Francisco to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Minneapolis. The crew were friendly told jokes and made me feel almost refreshed despite having a long Osaka-Hong Kong-San Francisco flight the day before. At times the flights either leave much to be desired or can be almost horrific as was the case on both flights I took with them on the 7th of October -- Minneapolis to Phoenix Phoenix to San Francisco. Surly crews with terrible service. Those two flights drained me more than the flight to Hong Kong despite having less than half the travelling time combined. Most flights are fairly pleasant if unremarkable. Despite the hits and misses I will likely continue flying with Southwest Airlines because they do not charge as many fees and generally speaking do their job with greater efficiency than any other domestic US carrier.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

First flight out at 7am and the plane had 'mechanical issues' so we were delayed. We missed our connecting flight. As we were deplaning the flight staff informed us that they held the Southwest connection for those 31 passengers going to Las Vegas however since there were only 19 of us headed to LAX we had to be rebooked. They proceeded to take us to Fort Lauderdale with an ensuing 7 hour layover and then a delay on the tarmac for another hour!

Southwest Airlines,3,Val Wilson,15th September 2013,I recently flew to New York City and my airport was LaGuardia. The flight to New York was fine and went without a problem. However my return flight home where I was on a time crunch was quite different. I recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of SW and for safety considerations all flights in and out of LaGuardia were delayed. The terminal at LaGuardia is far too small to accommodate the business for Southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. SW had one Customer Care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. Finally another representative showed up. Then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. It was unbearable in that worn out terminal - nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. I stood in- line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisor/manager that there would no problem. After 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal I went out of security back down to the check-in counter where I found a representative who was helpful. I don't think I will take SW to New York especially via LaGuardia ever again.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Following the people in line in front of me I presented my boarding pass to the attendant and she responded in such a rude way I never want to fly Southwest again. As I presented my boarding pass without eye contact she handed it back to me. Instead of placing it back in my hand she practically tossed it to me landing on the ground. She instead grumbled this isn't your group. Please wait to board when I call your group. Confused I replied is this group B?” She stared at the pass for a while and responded “Oh I thought I called the wrong group!” And finally let me board. This frustrated me as the attendant didn't make eye contact with me the whole time we were talking. The captain and crew members were unprofessional and laughed many times over the main speaker when making announcements. My flight was on Sunday around 10.30am departing from Vegas.

Recent trip to LAS we booked Southwest for the non-stops on this round trip. Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin. They do serve a niche.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

The initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier check-in times so you get a chance to sit together. I checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. To my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats! This airline is a nightmare!

More frequent and longer delays have me worried about the future and continuing to use SW exclusively. I have found that the best way to avoid said delays is taking one of the first few flights of the day avoiding delays that seem not to stem from weather/mechanical issues but rather confusion that just seems to pick up steam throughout the day.

Southwest Airlines,,A Moresco,3rd July 2013,This is one of the worst customer care I have seen I booked my a flight for my children (12 and 9) as junior travelers because SWA had told me they would allow my sister to pick them up at the gate and they do not need someone there through out the flight. Flight delayed an hour and did not allow my sister to the gate. SWA personnel told her they would bring back the kids. However when my sister saw the woman (without the kids) her answer was they did not pay the fee. SWA left them to sort it out on their own at 2am at Boston airport!,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,Christina Schell,21st June 2013,I am from Tucson and live in San Diego. I make about 3 trips per year back to Tucson and usually drive every time. I decided to try flying to save time. The car picked me up at 6.55pm on 6/12 for flight 499 from SAN to TUS (9.05 flight time). I waited in the Airport for 2 hours until we finally boarded at 9.15pm sat on runway for 20 minutes and finally took off at 9.42pm. Again the flight was supposed to take off at 9.05pm. Crew were unapologetic and slow moving. We didn't land until 10.50pm. On the way back to San Diego on flight 1858 we were supposed to leave at 9.30am. It is 9.39am now and the estimated departure is now 10.15am. I have heard no updates from staff. No announcements. I will never fly Southwest again.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,10,M Thompson,19th June 2013,23-27 May 2013 Columbus OH - CMH to Ft. Lauderdale FL - FLL. Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes. Southwest gave us a credit for the trouble without us asking.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

It got us to our destination 5 hours late I missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time. I called SWA and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for $300 to cover the cost of the car. I was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best. The crew etc were fine no issues there.

I have never had this many flight delays in my 10 years of flying combined that I have had with SWA in the last 2 days! The weather has been good! If you want to save money and don't care about things like arriving/departing on time they aren't that bad. Also I am not a fan of the royal rumble/every man for his own seat scenario that plays out every flight. I sincerely felt as if we were playing musical chair every time that we dumped off another filled-to the seats load that we just picked up on our fourth stop. Putting my bag way in the front and then hiking to the back for my seat wasn't a blast either. All in all the savings in my opinion does not warrant the lack of professional services that should be granted from an airline.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,1,R Hesser,27th May 2013,"LAX-LAS-DEN flight delayed due to mechanical problems. After a 2 hr delay gate agent announced we would receive $100 vouchers off future travel. We couldn't re-book on the next flight as it was full. Unfortunately problem was not fixed and flight was canceled 4 hrs after scheduled departure. We were re-booked and arrived 6 hours late. While I understand mechanical issues happen such a long delay is unacceptable on a short 1 hr flight such as LAX-LAS. Southwest should have been able to swap out an aircraft at a major hub such as LAX. Prompt re-booking when the problem was first discovered could have got passengers to their destinations sooner. Otherwise cabin was clean and In-flight service good featuring pretzels peanuts and complimentary soft drinks. The new ""Evolve"" seating is uncomfortable and cramped with 31"" pitch. Admittedly such a lengthy delay is not customary for Southwest but their overall punctuality and cabin comfort has deteriorated in the past few years.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

This was on Flight 110 from FLL to BNA on May 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. However 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. I have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 60-90 mins. This speaks about Southwest's abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. The flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 5-10 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill. There hasn't been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or ETA is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,8,Lee Ho Seok,6th March 2013,CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected.

Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers. However planes with the newer seats can be a little uncomfortable on the thighs after 3 hours or so beware on longer flights.

Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point.

Southwest Airlines,4,J Malinoski,16th September 2012,"Most recently I flew round trip from Bradley in Hartford CT to BWI. Southwest is definitely a mixed bag. I guess if you have a small barking dog it's great for you. Unfortunately if you are stuck on the plane in the vicinity of this yapping dog which yapped incessantly for the entire flight it's not so great. If you were lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket that's wonderful but if you end up with ""C"" like I did that means you are forced to fend for yourself to try and find space in the overstuffed overhead bins. Since I don't check baggage and can never seem to be lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket I'll only fly Southwest out of sheer necessity. It's always a free-for-all stampede of confusion-in this case the flight was overbooked so you've got people milling about unsure what's up. The space for standing in line for the flight is ludicrous since the line is largely ignored by most-like standing in line at the movie theatre for tickets-all of a sudden people just happen to show up to join their party and cut in front of you without an excuse me or any kind of courtesy whatsoever. Flying on Southwest is like getting on a bus-no assigned seats. You definitely feel like part of the herd only difference is you do get a couple of packages of peanuts and a cold drink from a smiling flight attendant.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,8,S Quei,16th September 2012,"Flew round-trip SJC-LAS-SJC outbound on Sep 11 (flight 328) returning on Sep 14 (flight 259). The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew. The return flight from LAS to SJC was uneventful. The airfare was substantially cheaper than their competition and service was nice once we got airborne.

Before the return flight my wife had to get something out of her luggage so we asked an employee if she could get it for her.

Southwest Airlines,10,E Battock,25th July 2012,We can all agree the airline industry is at an all time low. My experience with SWA yesterday restores my faith that someone cares about passengers. A four hr delay at Midway - airport staff were apologetic and sincere the crew were accommodating and we received an unexpected $100 voucher. SWA used to be the cheapest but the fares have gone up. I believe to cover free baggage. But in our case it was cheaper because the fees on the other airlines made their flights higher. I know their are a lot of complaints about seats. I used to hate SWA for that reason. I also don't like that the 24hr checkin still gives you only an A30 at best since they sell the first half of the A seats now for business select or a fee. But if you check in early you still have a good selection. The other airlines are sneakier. You may get an assigned seat but do you really have a choice? Most of my recent flights have shown me a chart selection of all centre seats and the aisles and windows for sale! Not a good way to build loyal customers.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

After waiting in the line for an hour with 5 kids and hearing other passengers leave the line being told they would not get a flight for 2 days I found a hotel and rented a car for the night. In the morning I called SW to ask about rebooking our canceled flight. The agent told me I had to go to the airport to get someone to do it for me. She confirmed that my only option to get on a SW flight would be to drag 5 kids to the airport to wait for the next available flight in 40 hours and hope we got on that one. That is not a reasonable option so we rented a minivan in Denver and drove to Chicago. SW also lost our luggage. Multiple attempts to call resulted in no one helping us.

We boarded the plane actually got the very first seat with tons of leg room and finally had the opportunity to stretch out for the long ride home. From the moment the plane was to take off the complaining started. I guess there was some sort of issue with the transair merger and the flight attendant union because that is all I heard about for the entire flight. They just went on and on as if they were out for coffee at some cafe. I don't even think they realized how inappropriate it was to complain while they were on the job and within earshot of customers. It made us very uncomfortable and annoyed. Once we landed and all of bags didn't make it that kind of sealed the deal for us. No more Southwest. Beware when you check your bags you may not see them again. We did get our bag back at midnight so we were the lucky ones.

Southwest Airlines,9,L Pulliam,4th June 2012,RNO-DEN-IAD-BWI-LAS-RNO. Good fares pleasant staff on-time for the most part and when a delay comes up we are informed. This trip held true to that again. But my only issue on this trip and it is not a fault but rather a comment. Flying cross country non-stop on a 737 for 5 hours is a bit brutal. We did get on a brand new 737-800 for the longest sector from BWI to LAS which was nice but still a very long trip on a small plane that was packed to the hilt. The crew were pleasant on all sectors. The ground staff at BWI were great and the Skycap had us laughing. All in all a good product with no complaints really. Just remember to buy a meal before you get on a long flight and if you don't mind a long flight on a small plane then Southwest is the way to go. Plus you can't beat the two free check-in bags.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

The gate agent spotted my family and I and came to personally asked us to board along with the other pre-boarders. Because of this gesture we now minimized flying Alaska Airlines.

Southwest Airlines,6,R Morrison,21st May 2012,Southwest are a cheap and cheerful airline and you get what you pay for. The cabin crew are generally friendly and helpful the aircraft's clean although seating is tight as you would expect on a budget airline. Over the past couple of years I have flown 7 sectors with them and my only complaint is with the ground check-in staff. They are with rare exception a miserable unhelpful lot who seem to think their faces would break if they smiled. The check-in system is different to what I am used to and the counter staff seemed to look down their noses in disdain when I was not sure how things worked. Would I fly with them again probably not there are a lot of other airlines competing for the same business.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

I would then take the risk of not being able to get the flights I need for my upcoming trip. Poor Customer Service Southwest.,"Cabin Flown Economy Class

Southwest Airlines,,J Fenston,11th July 2011,"Never flying Southwest again. Their boarding/seating process is horrible and needlessly stressful; their ""new hip"" thing among flight staff is really annoying. My fiancé and I flew across the country to get married last weekend. Of course we wanted to sit together on the 5 hour flight. But with the ridiculous system of no assigned seats there was no way to assure this. On the way back we got stuck in separate seats surrounded by a yelling and singing boy scout troop. To make things worse the flight attendants cranked up the volume on the PA system and sang the safety demonstration. In fact all announcements were done in song. This should be illegal. They seemed to think it was clever but it was a real nightmare to be strapped into one of those tiny seats surrounded by pimply screaming boy scouts and then endure warbling flight attendants blasting through the overhead speakers. A truly horrible airline. I will pay double triple quadruple to avoid flying Southwest. I will walk or crawl across the country rather than fly with these people.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

My father passed away two weeks prior to our scheduled departure. I called SW seeking assistance. After a brief discussion regarding the circumstances and flight availability the associate announced a fee of $783.00.

Southwest Airlines,,J Webber,31st May 2011,"Extremely disappointed in Southwest's recent changes to the policy on the inability to change a passenger name once the ticket has been purchased. I bought a ticket for an employee before this policy took effect who was not able to make the trip. Since then SW started supposedly ""enforcing a policy that has been in place"" without any sort of notification. Now I'm out almost $500 because they won't refund the ticket or allow me to use the credit for another passenger - even if it's just transferred to my name. Their reason when I filed a complaint? ""a proactive step to align our business with the general practice of the airline industry"" So it seems SW is in fact purposefully intending to become just another airline. The really upsetting part is that only a week or two earlier another trip for an employee had to be cancelled and I was able to use the flight credit for someone else. Suddenly I can't. No notification at all. I get emails just about every other day from SW advertising their ""get- away"" deals; couldn't they have simply sent out an email letting us know their policy was going to go into effect? I was an extremely loyal SW customer but they've lost my business for good.

Southwest Airlines,2,Patrick Lenahan,7th May 2011,"Beware more and more Southwest is just another airline. Latest casualty is the previously elegant Rapid Rewards program which used to be 16 credits=1 free flight virtually no restrictions. It has now devolved into just another points system with ever more restrictions. During the transition they are still using Awards which was the mechanism by which you reaped the reward of a free flight. But do not convert points into an award - if you do so mistakenly you will never get them converted back into points. Found this out trying to book a flight by converting to award first which was akin to the previous protocol but the flight had ""no"" award seats available. You could buy a seat with your points but after conversion to award I didn't have enough points available and Southwest has made their system physically incapable of correcting the conversion not even during this period of new learning for their customers. They make no statement that I could find that such conversions are irrevocable. In other words if you make a mistake too bad - you can pay for a ticket but Southwest won't help you correct your points v. award error and you have to wait for another flight within the coming year to use it. Yes the award expires though the points do not while you continue to generate trip activity.","Cabin Flown Economy Class

On the return trip we were not able to participate in the competition to call within 24 hours and get an ""earlier"" boarding assignment as we were travelling in a remote area with no cell coverage. Therefore as we were among the last to board we (and many other couples) were not able to sit together. The flight attendants ""helped"" by continuing to instruct us to just ""find a seat single seats only available"". We ended up separated by 20 rows. The reason for this practice must have something to do with saving the airline money because there is no apparent benefit for passengers. But the on line seat selection process that all the other airlines use is obviously computerized and can't cost much if anything to oversee so why does Southwest do this?? Certainly feels like one of those brilliant ideas the management team comes up with that blindly ignores the needs of some passengers. Won't fly Southwest again.","Cabin Flown Economy Class
