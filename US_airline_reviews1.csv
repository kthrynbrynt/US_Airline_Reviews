Alaska Airlines,10,Jack T Rogers,15th October 2017,"Verified Review | Redmond to Denver. I wanted to acknowledge the outstanding assistance I received from a booking agent of the Alaska Air Seattle, WA. office in making last minute reservations for two separate trips I was planning to take. The agent patiently walked me through the process to book a flight from Redmond, OR to Denver, CO. on October 3rd, 2017. She also assisted me in booking a flight for my wife and I round trip from Portland, OR to Fort Myers, FL departing on April 24th, 2018 and returning May 19th, 2018. She was friendly and polite throughout our entire contact and serves as a great representative to Alaska Airlines which is why I continue to choose Alaska AL whenever available.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Redmond to Denver,October 2017,4,4,,,4,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,B Cox,11th October 2017,"Verified Review | Flew Seattle to Sacramento. First they bumped us from premium when they downgraded our plane, then they moved my large child onto my lap and I was forced to buy a new ticket at last minute prices (4x what I originally paid). Then they boarded and we sat on the runway forever before they returned to the gate to let someone on. How important did that person think they were. If they were sick or something I'd be happy to accommodate them but they seemed decidedly not in special circumstances, then we sat again for 20 minutes. By the time we took off we were supposed to have landed. My poor daughter was worked by the stress of the situation and I ran out of snacks and tricks. Seriously unhappy with the service.",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Seattle to Sacramento,October 2017,2,1,,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Jason Kreitzer,9th October 2017,"Verified Review | New York to Lihue via Seattle. I booked a trip to Hawaii on Alaska almost 1 year before the flight date. This week, Alaska decided to change all of their flights, turning what would have been an 11 hour trip to New york into a 20+ hour trip with an overnight layover. I am flying with a 9 year old. When I called two days ago the agent had offered to fix my trip by routing us from Ogg->LAX->JFK. I called back today (2 days later) to take them up on that offer, and the agent said she would be unable to do that, and that I'd have to buy a whole new ticket. This is ridiculous on multiple levels. First, I paid $3000 for the voucher I used, which was donated by an Alaska executive at a Parkinson's charity auction. I am happy to track down and document all the details of that. Second, It is the airline schedule change that is causing this issue. Third, Alaska Airlines offered me this remedy two days ago, which was not ideal, and are now retracting that offer. Frankly, I'm speechless. This is the worst customer service experience I've had in a long time. Probably ever. And this is just the return flight. For the outgoing flight, they've change the schedule so that my connection now departs before I arrive. There is another flight from JFK (rather than Newark) that would solve this issue, but they are unwilling to make that change, due to some technicality in their system -- even though these airports are 20miles apart. See the picture below. It's a total joke.",,Business,First Class,New York to Lihue via Seattle,June 2017,,,,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,K Seely,27th September 2017,"Verified Review | Tried Alaska Airlines once, never again. Flying from Phoenix to Edmonton with a connection in Seattle. Phoenix to Seattle left on time, but was 25 minutes late. We got to our gate in Seattle 10 minutes before our flight was supposed to leave to have them say sorry, go rebook with customer service. It was their mistake and they still wouldn't let us on the plane that was at the gate. Will never fly or recommend this airline.",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Edmonton via Seattle,September 2017,2,2,,,1,2,no
Alaska Airlines,9,S Schinkel,20th September 2017,"Verified Review | Portland to Santa Barbara. I had a wonderful trip. Got in early and just perfect. On my way home had a rather interesting trip. First our plane was late. Arrived at PDX alniatcan hour late. Then had maintenance issues, somleft Oregon line an hour late. Everything seemed fine, but then just as we were going to be landing in Santa Barbara, tee were diverted to Fresno for sone issue with a stabilizer and needed a longer runway. I was a bit freaked, but we landed safely in Fresno. All were taken off the plane, and were in Fresno for about an hour. Were given food vouchers and snacks. Thankfully it turned out it was not a stabilizer, but the computer and plane were not synched correctly and was easily fixed. We were in Santa Barbara after this in a half hour. I think the flight crew were wonderful as was the pilot and co pilot. Our safety was number 1, and to me that means a great deal. Would fly Alaska again and feel secure with them.",Embrauer175,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Santa Barbara,September 2017,4,5,4,,3,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,Simon Castleman,14th September 2017,Verified Review | Flight from Seattle to Bozeman was delayed by 2 hours and after a long trip the last thing you need is a long delay. The FA's did a good job considering that everybody was annoyed at the delay. The problem was lack of credible information on the ground. The delay kept being extended and extended. I think Alaska Airlines could have done a better job keeping us informed.,Dash 400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Bozeman,August 2017,2,4,2,,1,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,C Roberts,26th August 2017,"Verified Review | Returning home to Phoenix from Alaska to Phoenix via Seattle. Had boarding passes issues in Anchorage. I had 15 minutes to get to my gate before boarding started which was unbelievably far away. Arrived at Gate C and sent me to gate N for which you have an underground shuttle. Once I arrived at my ticketed gate I found they move to back to gate C on the other side of the airport. Had to run like a fool and barely made it at the cost of running around people. All the ""smiles"" from flight crew don't over ride the lack of communication and help by gate personnel when simply said ""your gate was moved - better hurry only 10 minutes till doors close"". Note to gate desk personnel - when you see a boarding pass was issued then changed with the gate you are in charge of, maybe you can be a little more helpful. And note to exit staff, maybe update passengers of connecting gate changes as they leave the plane. Seems like the 1st rule in transportation. Help your customers find their destination when you make a change or issue a incorrect boarding pass. Maybe even offer to call the correct gate people to tell them you are on your way.",Boeing 737-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Phoenix,August 2017,3,4,3,2,1,2,no
Alaska Airlines,1,E Dorlan,15th August 2017,Verified Review | Seattle to Ontario. Flight was canceled and then they booked me on an oversold flight. It is extremely frustrating when you get the the ticket counter and the attendant tells you that the flight is overbooked! Who's fault is that? They make it sound like it is our fault.,,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Ontario,August 2017,1,1,,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,C Saunders,14th August 2017,"Verified Review | We flew from Saint Louis to Anchorage with Alaska Airlines. One of our bags did not make it on the plane in Seattle. When we arrived to Anchorage, we realized it did not arrive. The luggage service told us they did not put the suitcase on in Seattle because the ""plane was too heavy"". They offered a $25 discount on future travel! They could not tell us when our luggage would arrive, despite at least 10 flights a day from Seattle to Anchorage. Furthermore, they could not tell us when we would receive a bag. Finally, they could not tell us what kind of allowance we could have to purchase gear needed for fishing which was in our bag. To make matters worse, the airline never communicated with us via phone to provide updates. The following morning, almost 24 hours later, the bag had not arrived. We were then informed initially that it would be on a train, then on a bus to Seward, 2.5 hours from Anchorage. The bag was then delivered to a random Bed and Breakfast in Seward. After multiple phone calls and hours spent, the bag was located and delivered to our lodge approximately 30 hours after arrival. Customer service could only offer $300 off future travel, even though we told them we wanted something else.",,Business,Economy Class,St Louis to Anchorage,August 2017,3,4,2,1,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Jonathon England,3rd August 2017,"Verified Review | Seattle to Honolulu. This was the most disappointing flight of my life. I had paid for Premium Seats at $60US extra. Then 3 days before our flight they email us, not call, to tell me that they are changing the aircraft and there are no premium seats. Well what happened to my $120? Oh it will takes up to 14 days to get that back sir. So not only did we loose our great seats in our this money till it's returned on there accord. During the flight we asked to by chips 3-4 times, every time they said ' Oh we are just checking for those"". Finally we land and still no chips during a 6 hour flight. Also, no Wifi connectivity through out the entire flight! Way to go Alaska airlines. I know I will never fly with them again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Honolulu,August 2017,1,2,1,1,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,M Armstrong,2nd August 2017,"Verified Review | The gross difference in cost for a first class ticket from Portland to Kansas City was around $314. $554 for first class, $240 for economy. Savings of $50 for 2 checked bags, around $10 (I think) for the hot meal, $7 each per drink, snack. Net difference is around $247, or $124 each 3 hr 30 min leg. FC ticket allows use of AL lounge at PDX (none at MCI), which was OK. FC cabin has 12 comfortable seats with power outlets and dedicated flight attendant. Free Gogoinflight service is barely satisfactory. Service, food and drinks were all good on both legs. Excellent FC check in service at both ends. Boarding / exiting first with ample overhead bins is nice. Question is: Would I fly FC again to this destination?

Alaska Airlines,3,Scott Roza,21st July 2017,"Verified Review | Another late flight out of SFO, which was 100 percent Alaska's fault. I've been MVP Gold 75k for 6-7 years in a row and their service and on time performance continues to decrease. This trip we fully boarded on time and at departure time the pilot announced that the plane wasn't fueled yet and was waiting on a fuel truck. 40 minutes later one showed up. This plane was sitting at the gate 30 minutes before boarding even started so there was no excuse. Ever since Alaska merged with Virgin, and moved to the Virgin gates, performance has plummeted. I plan to spend more and more on Delta. You no longer earn my business Alaska.",,Business,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Seattle,July 2017,3,2,2,,1,2,no
Alaska Airlines,8,E Reese,8th July 2017,"Verified Review | Redmond to Reno via Portland. I've had a lot of good experiences with AlaskaAir, but this trip was not a good one. Two hours before the flight, I get an e-mail saying ""Sorry, your flight has been canceled."" However, the e-mail, ios app, and online all showed the same exact itinerary. It wasn't until I arrived at Portland did everything update to show that my PDX-RNO flight was completely canceled. I was auto-booked for a flight the next day. Not only is that terrible, but the lady at the counter was able to fit me into the last seat on a flight that afternoon, which means the auto-booking system isn't helpful. I had to sit in Portland twiddling my thumbs for 8 hours, and it was awful. Here's the redeeming qualities of Alaska Airlines, the rep gave me some vouchers for food and snacks, and discount codes for my next booking. Not a worthy trade to me, but at least they were apologetic and tried to remedy the situation as best they could. Like I said, this was my only bad experience with Alaska so I won't swear them off for that. Except for the flight attendant that skipped over me for a drink. That was annoying.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Redmond to Reno via Portland,July 2017,4,4,2,,4,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,C Andrews,28th June 2017,"Verified Review | My husband and I have flown Alaska several times to LA before and have never had a problem with them. However, this time I was traveling back to Washington alone with my 2 year old. We called earlier and asked if someone would be able to help me carry his 40 lb car seat to the gate. They said if we arrived 2 hours earlier we could request a gate pass. So on the day of the departure we arrived early and found out that they wouldn't give us one. No explanation. So I had to carry the car seat, my luggage, and have my 2 year old running behind me to make it through the tsa screening and walk all around to find our gate. It was a terrible experience and I don't understand why they said one thing on the phone and then no in person.

I only checked my luggage to Portland and thought I had to get it and check it again. A very nice lady checked the possibilities to check my luggage all the way, and I did not even ask for it.

Alaska Airlines,9,S Fallon,7th June 2017,"Verified Review | Detroit to Seattle. Phenomenal service, excellent food. This is my first time flying Alaska, and I chose them because they're partners with Virgin, it was my best flight in a quite a while. This plane was older and the interior was showing wear, so I was a little concerned about what to expect - worry not, you're in for a top notch experience with Alaska Airlines. Service was super friendly and attentive, meals were designed by Seattle chef Tom Douglas (I skipped the entree & dessert, so I can't comment on that) but the salad was very nice, dinner smelled wonderful (pesto), dessert was gorgeous, and the beverages never stopped flowing. I've read reviews that Alaska's first class chairs are uncomfortable due to pitch, I didn't find this to be the case - I found them very comfy, but this was only a 4-5 hour flight. The only slight negative was I had planned to work in-flight and the barely there internet connection made that impossible - they use GoGo and it runs $24 for an in flight pass. I'm not sure if the wifi problems were a GoGo issue, a hardware issue, or due to some other factor. I didn't mind though, it was nice to take a break and enjoy some on board entertainment. Even better - the cost for this first class nonstop flight was only around $100 more than the next best option - an economy carrier with seating headaches, no meal service, and connections amounting to twice the travel time! Alaska Airlines - my new favorite carrier!.",,Solo Leisure,First Class,Detroit to Seattle,June 2017,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,F Durand,2nd June 2017,"Verified Review | My first experience with Alaska Airlines flying from Portland to San Francisco. Not happy with ground staff who charged me 75 dollars for a slightly overweight check-in luggage. I was travelling with a First class ticket and with my baby. On board, cabin crew were all very nice.

Alaska Airlines,10,Justin Combs,30th May 2017,Verified Review | Bozeman to Anchorage via Portland / Seattle. I'm blown away at how far this company has gone to help me get home. My booking agent took me on a wild ride with a 6 hour layover in Portland and a 11 hour layover in Seattle. When checking my bag the agent said no this won't do we can't do this to you and told me to speak with my gate agent for help. As busy as my gate agent was she worked with 3 others to get my flight from Seattle to Anchorage bumped up shortening my layover. They told me to get on standby in Portland asap to avoid this 6 hour layover. On Memorial Day I got the last seat. I'm heading to Seattle 5 hours early and might get home to my dogs tonight if standby works in Seattle. I want to thank the outstanding Alaskan Airlines team for helping me get home the quickest most affordable way possible.

Alaska Airlines,10,B Redman,16th May 2017,"Verified Review | A direct return flight to Seattle from Boston. Both ways were on time, which is generally regarded as mission impossible in the Boston Logan airport - no idea how they manage to pull it. The return flight landed half an hour early which was very much appreciated, considering that it was almost midnight. Alaska guarantees that the bags are delivered to the carousel 20 minutes from the moment the disembarkation starts, both times it was faster than that. Drinks were served 3 times during the 5 and half hour flight. The selection of meals for purchase was generally so so, but no demerit points for that since it's expected of all airlines. They did give a free cookie. Ample space between seats. The wifi was sluggish at times, but the entertainment package was fine. The crew were efficient and polite. But it's the service that made me write the review making sure the airline gets a deserved praise. After the outbound flight, our bag was nowhere to be found. We filed a report while a very patient and nice customer service lady told us what may be happening. She also said that the bag may arrive while we are filing the report as it may have been misdirected elsewhere in the airport. This is exactly what happened. Her apologetic and helpful attitude was already compensating for the inconvenience. However, we were given $50 discount off the next flight. On the flight back, something started dripping on me from above. It turned out some kind of saline solution from another passenger's bag (makes me happy that they prohibit carrying acids and dangerous chemicals!). The crew rushed with napkins, cleaned everything up, made sure the dripping stopped within minutes, and we got all the alcohol and the food for free. This is how the airline service is meant to be. Well done, Alaska!",Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Seattle,May 2017,5,5,5,4,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Cynthia Yocum,14th May 2017,"Verified Review | We flew from Detroit to Seattle to Oakland and then finally to Maui, all flights were Alaska Airlines and I was very impressed. I am one of those people that are afraid of flying but never once did I feel unsafe. The flight attendants were very friendly and accommodating. The only complaint I would have is probably the same for all airlines, it is just so cramped and when flying 5 hours becomes very uncomfortable. I will definitely recommend Alaska Air to anyone looking for a great airline.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Maui,May 2017,3,5,3,3,5,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,11th May 2017,"Unverified | Anchorage to Portland. Another great experience on the best airline in the Pacific NW if not the USA. The flight down to Portland was just great, a redeye. I sat with two other Veterans so we were able to spend some time comparing our service activities, places, people and things. The flight was as good as could be hoped for - clean plane, wonderful crew and on time to boot! The flight to Chicago was perfect in all respects. I was moved to First and sat next to a young lady who works for Alaska. We spoke about a number of subjects and I inquired about her time with the airline. She said she is very pleased to be with them in the reservations department. I told her I am a Gold member and really enjoy the flights I have had these past seven years. I spoke with two of the flight attendants and thanked them for their obvious hard work and great attitudes. Again, the flight was smooth, great service and fine food.

Alaska Airlines,4,Jim Snell,11th May 2017,"Verified Review | San Francisco to Matzitlan via Los Angeles. Alaska and Virgin America are merged except for computers. I can't even post a review on alaskalistens because the form doesn't recognize my itinerary. I booked thru Alaska Airlines and they put me on Virgin America for the SFO to LAX leg. When I got to SFO they couldn't book my luggage to Mexico. The counter agent observed or booking was stupid. We told him Alaska booked it this way. First leg ended in LAX, point to point. So our luggage could book thru. After three levels of supervisor and 45 minutes the ticket agent figured a way to get the luggage to Mexico but advised us to check in Mexico to avoid the issue returning. No agent in Mexico would take responsibility for the issue. As a consequence when we got to LAX on the return we had to shelp our bags from terminal 6 (Alaska) to terminal (3) Virgin to recheck them in. Took so long we missed our flight to San Francisco. We are long time Alaska users with a credit card and a mileage plan. Very disappointed. If they try to put you on Virgin for one leg be forewarned that they haven't worked out all the kinks is the merger. And I couldn't even make this statement to Alaska direct because the company doesn't acknowledge an SFO to Matzitlan itinerary using Virgin for one leg.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to Matzitlan via Los Angeles,May 2017,3,5,,,3,3,yes

I booked a flight first class using mileage in April 2017 and realized how terrible this airline has become. They cancelled my flight two days prior to departure and I received no notification or rebooking. I spoke with customer service the day prior after trying to check in and the agent was rude, short, and told me no I can't find anything to rebook you on.

Alaska Airlines,7,N Rennie,18th April 2017,"Verified Review | Los Cabos to San Francisco. Alaska Airlines is a great airline overall. Their service and staff, flight attendants are very nice and helpful. Entertainment can be good depending on which aircraft you go on. If you are on a flight longer than 3.5 hours, then you can rent their entertainment tablet for around $8 or $10. This includes free movies and games. If your flight is under that, then bring your own device and download the Gogo app before departing. You will be able to watch free movies if your airline has wifi. It's great that they have power outlets. Wifi is expensive at $16. You don't have to purchase wifi in order to watch entertainment on your device. The seats are a little smaller than some airlines and not the most comfortable. But they do recline pretty far back.

Alaska Airlines,8,Stephen G Sweet,9th April 2017,"Unverified | My wife and I recently flew to Kona, HI from Anchorage, AK. Prior to boarding we took in the Alaska Boardroom and enjoyed our time there. We flew in the Premium Economy section and had no complaints. The food was fine as was the service. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. Upon landing in Kona we went to pick up our bags but as luck would have it, ours and 40 other folks did not have any! As it turned out, these bags were left in Anchorage. Something to do with weight, headwinds or whatever. This was not something that we expected and we were not pleased but Alaska did try to meet our needs somewhat. We were offered either a coupon for $100 off a future ticket or 4 thousand miles on our Mileage Plan. I took the miles as did my wife. Our luggage was delivered the next afternoon. There were some folks who were quite upset over this and I felt bad for the employees having to try to meet their needs. Our stay in Kona was not good due to sickness for the entire 11 days but I must say it was a beautiful place, we plan to return and stay where we were this time. Kona is not a bad place to be sick I must admit! Our return trip went through Seattle and again we were in P/E section. Everything was fine, again a great crew, clean plane and wonderful service.

Alaska Airlines,1,L Mellon,29th March 2017,"Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Honolulu. Been trying to resolve this with Alaska Airlines since we got to Hawaii but they still aren't so I'm going to put this out there for my friends & family. I tried to do something awesome for my mom since it was her birthday and her first time to Hawaii so I upgraded our seats to ""premium"". Premium seats are terrible for the following reasons: If I can't store my carry on under the seat in front of me because it's a row behind first class which only has 2 seats then the seat isn't premium. If I have the ""first class curtain"" hanging in my lap and in my face every time someone walks through it then it's not a premium seat. If I have to go from row 7 all the way to the back of the plane to the lavatory, then the seat isn't premium. If it says I get chocolates, almonds & cranberries & what I get is 1 square of dark chocolate, a snack size bag of blue almonds (approximately $0.50) and a snack size bag of ocean spray cranberries (approximately $0.50) then it's not premium. If it says to power up with a power outlet at every seat but every seat on the whole plane has one including the regular fare seats then it's not premium. When it say complimentary drinks but the attendant comes by once the whole flight that's not premium. When it says I can recline but the seats only go back as far as the normal seats then it's not premium. When your web site advertises premium upgrades starting at $15 but I had to pay $150 per ticket, I should've already known it wasn't going to be a premium experience.

The flight attendants were really kind and friendly and seemed like that they loved their jobs.

I get that stuff happens but doing all you can to fix a wrong is appreciated and good costumer service. Alaska Airlines staff repeatedly told me it wasn't their fault but I'm the customer and it wasn't my fault either. If you provide a service sub par make it right and don't make a costumer feel like it was their mistake or that they have to pay for a mistake they didn't cause. I paid for a hotel and would have had to pay too much to get on the next flight out. That is unreasonable.

Our gate was switched twice, a sign of what was to come. As was the hard of hearing old man that the gate staff refused to help. The 8pm flight was delayed so badly that it became clear that we would miss our connection in Seattle. The bumbling idiots at the ticket counter couldn't figure out a solution to this issue, since their system doesn't link with better airlines (such as Jetblue). They put us up in a hotel for the night with the promise of a non-stop first class, 6:15am flight (to Newark, when our car was at JFK). Midway through the flight, we are diverted to Pittsburg, where we were trapped on the plane for 3 hours. After an announcement that we were going to Baltimore next, we took off for Newark, landing at 7:30pm . From 6:15am to 7:30, we were offered one fruit plate and some small snacks. We had to take a cab home. The next morning, we took a two buses and a train to our car at JFK .

Alaska Airlines,1,John Nunes,16th February 2017,Verified Review | We booked our flights in July 2016 with Alaska. It's February 2017. From Kona to Seattle they had the family split up including our 5 year old. They did not care at all (that's the way flights work she said they have to make money). Then the flight attendant prosseded to give my 5 year old pop every time he would ask but my wife and I were not sitting in same row and could not see. My wife got to sit beside 2 people that had to use belt extensions - it was fun for her. When we got to Seattle they had seats for us - one for me but the kids and wife they oversold. They know when you book flights how old people are so the idea of splitting up a mother or father and a 5 year old is ridiculous. The other part is how do you oversell a seat when you book it 8 months early.,Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kelowna to Kona via Seattle,February 2017,1,4,4,5,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,R Matthews,13th February 2017,"Verified Review | Seattle to Los Angeles. Alaska Airlines has gotten better over the years but still has a ways to go. Many of their flights are still late and they generally do an awful job of updating the electronic screens at the gates. The screen will say a flight is boarding in 5 minutes when there isn't even a plane at the gate. It's also comical how Alaska charges most of their passengers to check a bag but then offers to do it for free as nearly every flight has issues with overhead bin space. So if you're flying Alaska check in online and choose zero bags to check. A screen or two later Alaska will usually offer to let you check your carry-on for free. And even if they don't, they almost certainly will offer to do so at the gate. Why not offer a free checked bag to everyone if you're going to offer that anyway? It's not fair to those who paid to check their bags. On the plus side their newest planes (the ""next gen"" 737-800 and -900) have more generous legroom and power at your seat. On the downside you have to use your own device for inflight entertainment. Alaska could learn something from Virgin American (which they now own). They do offer free (for now) streaming shows over WiFi but it's cumbersome, buggy, and you have to click past several screens trying to sell you GoGo inflight WiFi. While they offer a decent selection of paid food and beverages they have only a single food and beverage cart for the entire plane and a 737-900 is a long plane. So it takes something like 45 minutes for the service to work its way from the front to the back. But my biggest complaint about Alaska is they have many flights that are chronically late, yet they refuse to change the scheduled times. Even the flight crews have no explanation why they don't change the scheduled times. Southwest flies many of the same routes and puts Alaska to shame with their on-time record on those flights. And if anything goes wrong, like bad weather (we recently had snow in Seattle, for example) look out as Alaska turns into total chaos - especially at SeaTac. Wait times exceed one hour for calling them, lines stretch way down the hall from their customer service counters, their website falls on its face from the load, etc. And if you do stand in line for hours trying to rebook your cancelled, or infinitely delayed, flight, you're usually offered nothing useful and a joke of a customer care package. Basically they just seem not to care as they already have your money. Alaska charges at least $125 to make any changes to most flights and it's often horrifically expensive if you have to make a last minute change. This is in stark contrast to Southwest that charges no penalties for changes. Alaska's boarding is annoying with several ""tiers"" of preboarding which often amounts to at least a third of the plane with many of those people still blocking the aisles once they start general boarding. Again, Southwest is a far more pleasant and efficient experience. But airlines like United are even worse in this regard. Overall, for west coast travel I often have my pick of Southwest, Virgin America, Alaska, Delta, and United. And I try to book flights in that order of priority. Alaska is my third choice after Southwest and Virgin.",Boeing 737-900,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,February 2017,4,2,3,1,1,3,no

I flew with a certified service animal from Dallas to Fairbanks via Seattle. On the plane from Dallas to Seattle my service animal (a large dog) were asked to deboard because they had sold the seat next to me. Both the gate agent and the reservations agent I spoke with encouraged me to buy an extra seat on the Seattle to Fairbanks flight to ensure there was room and stated a refund would be issued with no problems if there were open seats left on the flight. Upon calling for my refund because there were open seats, the customer care agent was extremely rude, said they would refund it only this once and never do that again.

The night before there was some snow but by the time we were going to leave it was clear. So like a typical there needs to be clearing of the runways, de-icing of the planes, etc., but it appeared that not only did they not take care of this prior to us boarding, but as we were boarding they still told us that we were leaving on time. Even after sitting on the plane 25 minutes after we were supposed to leave, we were finally told we were going to have to pull out on the side of the runway and wait another 40 minutes to de-ice and wait for the plane's oil to warm up. I understand that all these things need to happen and sometimes there's issues, it's just the poor preparation and the lack of communication that makes this service dissatisfying.

At that time I requested that if they were going to do the same flying back from there to Los Angeles to inform me then so I can change plans and confirmed that they wouldn't. Later they called me and said that they had equipment change so they have to downgrade me again on the return flight. Amazing, by then too late to have last minute changes during Christmas times.

I felt like I was launched back to the 80s and 90s when it seemed airlines really cared about their passengers. I can't say enough about the quality of the crew aboard each airplane. Remember the old days when you were told several times during the flight what was going on? Last night we experience turbulence on the flight and the captain announced to us more than once that it was going to be intermittent throughout the flight and why, jet stream winds that we were going through and not to worry as it would not get worse than what we were experiencing. He was very reassuring and kind. Also, when do you have the cockpit crew stand with the flight attendants as you are leaving the cabin to greet passengers? Extremely impressed! The absolute only negative is that the planes are a little old and the seats are not that comfortable, but each seat has an electrical plug and there is wifi on the airplane.

But I would have expected the airlines to pay a bill for 25 Dollars to help the excess cost that I had to take upon myself because of this situation.

Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,1st November 2016,"Anchorage to Nashville via Seattle. Another great trip with Alaska Airlines. The flight down to SEA was on their Combi 400 the cargo / passenger plane. Nice flight with a great seatmate. Arrival was early as it was a redeye. Spent some quality time at the Boardroom as I usually do - no issues there. I was bumped up to First on the leg to BNA. The crew and service was great, no problems noted. I arrived on time and thanked the crewmembers for the great service. The return to ANC was a bit unusual for me this time as I flew to SEA spent the night and then departed the next morning. The flight began about 30 minutes late due to storm issues in Seattle which caused some backup in the system but it was no problem on my end. The flight was quite bumpy in parts but no problems. The service was great as was the food. Arriving in SEA I slepped over to the fine USO located there and spent the evening talking with the outstanding staff and various Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen who were enjoying the hospitality as I was. I got to my 8:30 AM flight and had the pleasure of sitting next to a fine Alaska attendant who was heading back to the Greatland. As I was departing the aircraft in ANC she noticed my wallet which had departed my pocket somehow and got it back to me. My only issue was at baggage claim. I watched the clock countdown and my bag got there in 21 minutes. As this was not the 20 minutes they strive for I grabbed my bag and went to get my 2500 miles added to my account. The young lady working there said they had made it as they did not go by the time which was at the claim area they go by another clock apparently which us passengers are not aware of. The lady in front of me was not pleased and neither was I. I told her as a Gold member this was the first time I had run into this issue and it sort of sounded like false advertising. I decided to not raise hell as I was tired and needed to get on the road home.

After paying for a full fare First Class ticket on the above referenced flight we were subjected to 5 hours of a screaming infant. Not an hour, not intermittent, but five straight hours. It’s bad enough Alaska Airlines allowed three other under six year olds in First Class but when did they waive a First Class age limit and allow infants?

This would be our third trip to Sin City this year. I was bumped up to First Class on this leg and once again the service was great, nothing to complain about. Our stay in Vegas was fun, after eating well and losing some dough, it was time to return home.

If you can contact them they will blame Bank of America who will in turn say they only provide information to Alaska on the ""billing cycle"" so if that does not come around before 90 days I do not get the bonus mileage.

Alaska Airlines,1,Jessica Berg,7th September 2016,"Verified Review | Newark to Yakima. Alaska Airlines is awful. I've primarily flown with them for the past 25 years and they've been going downhill. They don't allow passengers on board during the boarding time, close doors early at airports, charge exorbitant fees for luggage (food, liquor, etc). They tell people to go to the customer service desk, which isn't even open, don't give options when they won't allow you on a flight that they've randomly decided you can't board because they've closed the doors early, and offer you a 50$ refund when you need to rent a car to dive over 4 hours because of it. They don't offer hotel stays, free luggage, or anything. This has gone from being the best airline, to being the worst airline, over the last 25 years. They have a ""20 minute"" baggage guarantee, which always takes longer and they never honor. They charge 100$ for a 20 min flight because they're the only airline that flies out of my small town.

Alaska Airlines,4,David Eldridge,1st August 2016,"Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta. I'm going to say Alaska Airlines 1st class is not worth the money for a number of reasons. Here's my observations from Seat 4D. No immediate service. No drinks/snacks as people are boarding. A usual perk of 1st. Personal entertainment devices aren't always available. (Even when they say you have your own). There is no difference in extra leg room between 1st and economy plus. Just 2 seats a row instead of 3, which is nice, but not for the price difference. Service onboard is not first class quality when compared to Delta, Virgin, Air New Zealand (to name a few). Not even close. Food, drinks, services just not that special. Alaska sells off vacant 1st class seats at the last moment if they're available for $50. This is painful. Great for the person who gets a $1000 seat for $50 - not good when you pay a premium for peace and quiet. But, it explains why they don't care about good service in 1st. Alaska needs to step it up. A ""wider"" seat just isn't worth the premium price.",,Family Leisure,First Class,LAX to PVR,August 2016,3,2,2,1,3,2,no

Alaska Airlines,6,I Chandramouli,19th July 2016,"AS 3380, Portland - San Jose, operated by Skywest. Check in at PDX was extremely smooth and efficient, so we had an hour to spare before boarding. Boarding was out of the cramped concourse A and began 10 minutes late with no explanation. Once aboard, the E175 was in good condition and was extremely spacious, even more so than the 737 on the outbound flight, although the overhead bins were small. A weight balance issue resulted in several passengers in the last few rows having to move forward, this took a while as FA's had to recruit volunteers and people were stubborn. Fortunately, we still managed to push back within 15 minutes of scheduled departure and were airborne after a short taxi. Cabin crew were nice, but they could have managed the timing of the short flight better. They spent the first half of the flight chatting in the galley. A small snack with the beverage was a nice touch, but it didn't start until halfway through the flight. Literally right after they finished the beverage service, a flight attendant came through with a trash bag when most people were not even finished, so most had to sit with trash on their traytables while the FA's resumed chatting in the galley. They had more than enough time to get the service done as the FA's on the outbound leg easily served an aircraft twice the size and we still had 20 minutes after the service during cruise. Finally, during final approach, they realized we needed them to collect the rubbish and did so. We landed in San Jose 20 minutes ahead of schedule, and they made sure to brag about Alaska's on-time performance flightstats award. Overall, AS will get you from Point A to B reliably with decent crew and good value, but they shouldn't sell themselves as a major legacy airline when they are really just a decent budget airline. While AS is certainly not bad, I usually try to book with Jetblue or Virgin America due to their combination of a low fare with great service.

Check in at SJC was a bit chaotic as there was little signage or explanation of the procedure for those who had checked in online. This created a mass of confused people looking for the bag drop. Once past security, the gate agent proceeded to yell all of the boarding groups instead of just using the PA. This was a bit bizarre since she used it for a couple of other announcements. Although old, the B737-400 was in decent condition for its age. Only issue in that respect was that my armrest was loose. Seat pitch was reasonable for someone who is 6'0"", especially considering the short duration of flight. We departed on time, but the aircraft PA volume was so low that passengers could barely hear announcements. Cabin crew also failed to enforce important safety regulations such as windowshades being drawn up for takeoff and landing. (So that people can easily see out in case of an evacuation). However, they did manage the short flight time extremely well regarding the beverage service. They all were extremely polite and genuine. This genuine caring among its cabin crews is one of Alaska's major strengths. We landed on time in PDX with the 20-minute baggage guarentee being met. Overall a nice short hop.

Prior to departure we were in the PDX Alaska Board Room (paid membership). The place was dirty. Boarding was slow, mainly because there seems to have been only one gate agent working a full flight. As a result, we pushed back about 15 minutes late. The gate agent acted as though we were a bother to her - a real attitude issue. The four FA's working the flight were more interested in chatting with each other and constantly checking their iPhones, than interacting with passengers. This was particularly true later in the flight when the FA's gathered in the forward galley for a chat-fest. Our seating area was filthy, with coffee stains and food crumbs on the tray tables and the area between the seats The IFE on Alaska is woefully inadequate; in 1st, you are offered a DigEPlayer (like a small tablet) preloaded with content. Your other choice is to stream content on your own device, but to do so, you must pay for it. This is inferior to the AVOD on American and Delta that is complimentary in 1st. First class catering (lunch) was a joke - a warm turkey sandwich. It was the one and only option. The worst part of the trip was the seating on the Boeing 737-900. First off, the 737-800/900 seat pitch on Alaska is less than on Delta and far less than on American. Moreover, the first class seats would not recline. The seats were miserably uncomfortable and inferior to the seats used by American and Delta.

The plane was clean and comfortable (it was one of the newest planes in the Alaska Airlines fleet, and our pilot half-jokingly reminded us to keep it clean as a result!), and the flight attendants were great. The inflight entertainment system worked really well with my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S6), and it was great having chargers with each seat, so that I didn't drain my battery life while watching TV shows or movies during the flight. It's also nice to have a number of free viewing options, along with full WiFi and additional movie/TV show options available (for an extra fee). I have nothing bad to say about my first Alaska Airlines experience, and do plan on flying with them again in the future.",Boeing 737-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SEA to LAX,November 2015,5,5,4,5,4,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Paul Spencer,1st January 2016,"Excellent service as usual from Seattle to San Diego. Whenever there is an opportunity to fly Alaska we do so even if the fare is not the cheapest because the service experience is always far superior to the other airlines. Virgin America is great too but has limited destinations - so therefore Alaska, together with their mileage program, is always the preference. They were serving a red wine by Browne Vineyards not the usual cheap stuff that other airlines serve - even in international biz class.",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,First Class,SEA to SAN,December 2015,5,5,4,,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,14th December 2015,"This was my eleventh and final trip this year. As a retired guy I have plenty of time on my hands, so I check out various airline vacation deals. I noticed a great deal to Las Vegas with Alaska Vacations. Departing on Monday, we flew to Portland on a daylight flight. The crew, plane and service was just fine all the way around. Landing at PDX we noticed how much rain the area had been receiving - what a mess. The airport was fine. We were there about an hour before we departed to the land of Lost Wages. The pilot informed us that the climb out may be a bit on the bumpy side and we had to stay at a lower altitude the entire way due to upper level turbulence. It was not bad at all. On our return, our departure flight was to be a bit on the bumpy side but we had been warned of this. Just prior to departing the pilot came out and talked to us about his 26 years of experience with Alaska and how much he, his co-pilot and crew appreciated our flying with them. I have seen this a couple of other times and I was impressed. The flight to SEA was great. Our departing Seattle was expected to be rough and we were informed that we would climb out at a lower altitude for some distance due to expected rough air, not bad though. We were on a new 737-900 which had been in service for about six weeks, still had the new plane smell. Everything worked great - the service, the food, our luggage arriving with us was a bonus as I was fairly certain it might not. All in all, the flights were great, the Vacation package was great pricewise and above all, Alaska continued to provide what I have come to expect, ""Service With Pride"".",Boeing 737-800/900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ANC to LAS via PDX/SEA,December 2015,4,5,5,4,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,29th November 2015,"My son and I flew down to SDF from ANC via ORD during Thanksgiving. I cannot say that ORD was fun that is for sure as they had a huge snowstorm on Saturday and it was a mess. The flight down on Alaska Airlines was fine as my son and I were bumped up to First. The service was great, the crew members were professional and caring. Everyone just wanted to sleep and that was fine with me as well. We arrived a bit early and had to wait awhile for our gate but no problem. We had a few hours to kill so we ate at Wolfgang P. and that was quite good. I enjoyed a breakfast Pizza. The flight to SDF was on American Air E-175. Decent overall, no complaints. Our return to ANC was uneventful for the most part. The Alaska Airlines flight departed on time from ORD. The flight had us in First again and the service was great. I did not eat the food as I had something prior to boarding. I watched a movie and then tried to watch a second one but my digiplayer froze up. There was a call for any medical persons on board as a young lady had a heart issue. It turned out to be fine, she was checked out by medics when we landed in Anchorage and did not have any further problems. All in all another series of great flights on Alaska Airlines. Fine, clean planes crewed by professionals who cared for their passengers - a first rate job!

There were mechanical issues that delayed the plane for a little over 2 hours. The Captain Hendricks the issues to the passengers in a friendly, concise and comforting manner. He kept us updated throughout the repair process. His reassuring manner relaxed me and helped to keep everyone calm and in good spirits even though we had to disembark the plane for a time period.

I use my miles and it is very easy. The airline provided complimentary beer or wine which is nice. I like the fact they would give us updates or the pilot would tell us weather conditions.

Alaska Airlines,2,Jamesa Marino,2nd November 2015,"Our flight #121 from Seattle to Anchorage was not only approx an hour and a half late but we also shared half the aircraft with a load of freight? To add insult to injury, the constant loud chatter of the stewardesses made it impossible to try to catch a few winks before our anticipated 1.30am arrival in Anchorage. The complete disregard for passenger comfort and well being was such a huge contrast to our prior experiences with Alaska Airlines which have consistently exceeded our expectations.

Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,31st October 2015,"Returned last night from Seattle with Alaska Airlines after visiting my daughter there. The flights were fine in both directions. I had hoped to get bumped up to First, however, that did not happen. I was pleased with seat 8F down and 9F back. There is only so much the flight crews can do on redeye flights but I will say the flight crew on the way back to the Greatland was impressive as one of the passengers two rows up from me experienced some type of medical issue. Three of the four attendants worked with him and all went well upon our arrival. We were ontime and had snow waiting for us - how nice. My bag was about one minute late so I received my 2500 mile voucher. I informed some of the other passengers who were waiting with me and they too got miles. I read the review of the unhappy customer who flew to Mexico recently, I have to say that the issue of paying for anything in First Class is incorrect based on my experience. You will hear back from their Customer Service folks and they will do what it takes to make things right for you. I hope it does.

From being told that my seat was sold to a different person and I'd have to rebook a different day to getting to an Alaska Airlines flight and getting seated fast and being appreciated for being in the military, it's refreshing to have such a nice and well trained staff that suits in customers in every way possible. Thank you",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Seattle,October 2015,4,5,3,4,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,K Voccia,22nd October 2015,"The seats were uncomfortable, barely reclined and featured an ""innovative"" design to provide 3"" of leg room. I'm tall and I would expect 1st class to provide extra leg room. Not on Alaska Airlines. My knees were crushed for a good part of the flight. Food, other than soft drinks all other beverages cost. Nothing was complimentary. The meal was a TexMex Salad that was mostly a pile of lettuce with cheese on top. A prepackaged cookie was thrown in. Coach had options better than First class. Upon asking for some fruit from coach I was told ""we'll see"" and it was going to cost me extra. Coffee was never offered and upon asking I was told maybe they had some in coach but they were out. Little to no complimentary inflight entertainment. That was going to cost too. As soon as we were over Mexican airspace the whole system went dead. No wifi. Not even when flying in American airspace. If it was offered, as apparently it was on some flights, it was going to cost. After meal service, I couldn't get a even a small bag of pretzels. No effort was made to make the flight more comfortable or to provide any alternative food. The crew was friendly enough but seemed inexperienced in providing any first class service. Oddly the flight began with an announcement from the pilot (male) on how attractive the all female flight crew was. I felt as if I had stepped back 50 years. Though minor, it wasn't appropriate or professional. My expectations for first class aren't all that high. A comfortable seat, plenty of leg room, complimentary beverages (inc wine), somewhat of a more substantial meal than you would receive in coach and at the very least a flight crew that tried to make your flight as pleasant as possible. Alaska Airlines provided non of these. No blanket or pillow, nothing to read - having to beg for coffee? And above all else I conveyed this info to Alaska Corporate/Customer Care. Nothing from them with even a hint they might want to retain a customer. If you are going to spend the extra money to arrive refreshed via flying first class, heed my advice, find another airline. I've never been disappointed by Virgin America. United, which is doing the bare minimum at least is providing the bare minimum.

Most everything went well with small exceptions. The flight crews did their jobs well, professionally, and with great attitudes. The flight back up to Anchorage had to stay at a lower altitude due to rough air however the pilot informed us of this just prior to lift off. All in all it was fine. The meal on the flight from Raleigh was quite tasty and desert was too.

I had the beverage cart slam into my shoulder and the crew member said ""stay out of the aisle. "" I might add that there were 3 larger people in this row.

We're both a little tall, my husband is 6'3"", and he had enough room to stretch his legs out in front of him without his knees touching. The food offered was limited but good. The staff was the most friendly staff I've ever encountered flying in 25 years. Our flights were on time. They arrived a bit early at the destination. The best part was the changing table in the bathroom. The prices were the best offered for the trip we shopped for too.

The flight from ANC to SEA was great, the crew was excellent, flight was on time, all in all no complaints whatsoever. I was looking forward to the next flight, SEA to Raleigh as this was the first time Alaska flew there. They had a nice going away ceremony at the gate with all sorts of breakfast items, short speeches and a ribbon cutting as well. The aircraft we flew on was the special Russell Williams plane which I think is the 900 model of the 737. It was quite the arrival in RDU! Although it was raining upon our arrival, there were numerous television crews both outside and inside to catch shots of the plane, crew and passengers. The RDU folks that greeted us, (about 75 or so) lined up, gave each of us a welcome to Raleigh bag of goodies plus clapped and cheered for us. I was amazed at the welcome - Southern Hospitality at its best! The only downside was that our luggage did not get to the passengers within the 20 minute guarantee. We each received the 2500 mile ticket to apply to our Mileage Plan - it's all good. The flight there was great by the way - 4 hours and 26 minutes with very little to gripe about.

Alaska Airlines,10,Y Issa,1st October 2015,"When I rushed into the Boston airport wearing my ten-month-old son in a baby carrier and balancing a 55 pound anxious dog in an oversized crate on an unthinkably tiny luggage carrier (oh, Logan!) while my three-year-old clung to my thigh things were looking bleak. We were running late and I wanted to check in the dog while my husband dealt with the rest of the luggage, the rental, and a looming police officer. I was frazzled, but the Alaska Air staff spotted me right away and from then on our travel experience went smoothly. He really made sure that all the documents are checked as quick as possible and helped me take the dog crate through inspection. No one gave me any trouble with the dog, and we received a ticked assuring us that she was on the plane with us in the cargo. We found her safe and sound at our destination. All the while the staff member was entertaining and patient with my curious and slightly anxious daughter and assured me that he will take care that my husband gets on the plane in time as he was late returning the rental car, which he did. Everyone else working with Alaska Air was very courteous and attentive as well. Since we booked our seats late, we were not assigned to the same row, and with two small children this six hour flight could have turned very ugly if we were kept apart. The flight attendants took care of this issue right away and adjusted our seating so that we were in the same row (also thanks to two gracious gentlemen who agreed to switch their seats for us). The flight was long but comfortable, there was enough leg room even in the economy seats with snacks, drinks, and entertainment tablets making the long flight with tired kids tolerable. By the way the food was hot and delicious. Another nice touch came when we requested an entertainment tablet which was ten dollars per piece. The flight attendant noticed that my husband gave it to our daughter right away, so she gave him another one at no extra charge. No one harassed us when our kids were getting loud and impatient (which happened couple of times and ended very quickly, they are such good kids), and no one mentioned anything to me as I was nursing my little boy for most of the flight. I only have great things to say about the Alaska crew, they were so professional and compassionate.

Alaska Airlines,1,Susan Sopp,17th September 2015,"There have been numerous incidents with Alaska Airlines while my daughter has lived in Mammoth Lakes over the past 5 years. Today, Sept 15, 2015 my daughter, who had made her reservation weeks ago to fly down and go on vacation to a central coast beach town, got a text at 1 pm today notifying her that her flight had been cancelled. The next flight is tomorrow evening which would have her arriving at 7ish and we are due to be at our vacation destination tomorrow. If she took the offer for tomorrow we would be losing one nights hotel stay nonrefundable as there is a 48 hour deadline to cancel. She called Alaska Airlines to get her refund as now she has to drive down to LA by herself in order to make our plan work. She asked why the flight was cancelled, already knowing what they would say. Alaska Airlines go to phrase for cancelling flights is ""mechanical problems"" when the flight isn't full enough. Sure enough that is what she was told. I'm thinking really, there are 3 hours before the flight leaves LAX for Mammoth and there isn't a working plane available to be brought in? Well, of course there is nothing a passenger can do or say to change the ""I don't really care about you"" attitude that exists in this situation. It is really sad that this happens fairly often which proves to me that Alaska Airlines really doesn't care about this particular flight. I feel Alaska Airlines should perhaps not be flying in to Mammoth Lakes every day.

The trip from Atlanta to Seattle was delayed due to a mechanical issue, starboard engine. This was fixed and we were about two hours late departing ATL. We were rebooked in ATL prior to finally leaving. This delay caused me to miss Flight 119 from SEA to ANC. I was rebooked on Flight 121 which is a Combi 400 737. Arrived at almost 3am and my luggage did not. None of the Atlanta folks luggage made it to ANC. I spoke with the luggage person and she said it would be sent out later on in the morning. I accepted this, not happy but it does happen. I called the MVP Gold customer service folks today to inquire about a partial refund for my flight as it had no 1st Class. She spoke to the accounting department and said I will get an $80 credit. The bottom line here is a customer who was not pleased overall, especially in regards to finding out about travel segments, some being refundable and some not. Oh well, live and learn.

Surprisingly, two Alaska Airlines employees came out and helped us with our luggage tags since they use a special holder to attach to the luggage.

We then returned to the gate and this ""gentleman"" was escorted off our plane. After that excitement we were off with no further issues. Upon landing at SeaTac I made my way eventually to the Boardroom where I enjoyed coffee and rolls, caught up on news and relaxed. The flight to ATL went fine. Again, plane was clean, crew was great and appeared quite professional in all regards. The return leg went fine. The pilot on the outbound leg to Seattle informed us of some possible rough air coming up over the St Louis area which folks appreciated. The food I ate was decent and the wine was enjoyable as well.

Alaska Airlines,1,Katy Montanez,26th July 2015,"Checked into Alaska Airlines at the Santa Rosa airport 2 hours before take off. The plane was 30 minutes late. Because they were late they decided to rush boarding and instead of the allotted 30 minutes it was more like 10-15 minutes. My 70 year mom and dad were right behind us in security. My husband and I got through security and we were rushed to get on the plane. I told them there were 2 more behind us. They decided to just cut the line there and didn't let them board! To top it off I was worried about my 70 year old mom (she was upset and crying) so I asked the flight attendant about my mom and dad not being on the plane. She snapped at me that it was too bad, and that they probably weren't there on time. I responded that we checked into the airport 2 hours previously. She said rudely, 'so?'. My mom ended up having to fly out of her way north to Seattle and them back down to San Diego to make it in time. Horrible airline, insensitive staff, rude, and couldn't care less about their customers and how they treat then.",,Business,Economy Class,Santa Rosa to San Diego,July 2015,2,1,1,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,Alwaleed Althani,23rd July 2015,"Short one and half hour flight, seats were comfortable, very friendly staff from check in until we disembarked and we were given a free snack and drinks.",Bombardier Q400,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Bozemon,July 2015,4,4,4,,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,15th July 2015,"Flew down to Louisville from Anchorage with a stop at ORD on the way. Bumped up to First again which was nice. Crew was great, plane clean and on time. I found nothing to complain about and arrived relaxed and pleased with the service. O'Hare airport in Chicago was a zoo. It was as crowded and noisy as Atlanta always seems to be. I went to the American Admirals Club and mellowed out for a few hours - fine service there and the views of the aircraft was a plus. Flight to SDF on American Eagle was fine - the E-175 they use was quite a nice aircraft for this short trip, great views from the large windows on board. The return trip back to ANC began again at SDF to ORD, same plane as above, fine service, nice crew etc. I was routed to Portland from Chicago this time. All went well, I was seated in economy and had no complaints. I purchased the movie viewer and was well entertained. Great service too. The flight to ANC was near perfect. Only problem encountered was that our luggage was about thirty five minutes late getting to us. I put in and received my 2500 free air miles for that issue. All in all, flights were fine, crews were great and on time for all sectors. I feel Alaska should move up to a 4 Star rating.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,First Class,ANC to SDF via ORD,July 2015,4,5,4,4,4,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,Streb Lovell,12th July 2015,"One way, PDX-LAX. Everything was smooth sailing. Seats were comfortable, staff were great, and the flight was on time. I also like the electrical outlets in the seats. The big disappointment was the food. Nothing substantial on this flight except cookies and a small bag of pretzels. They made such a big deal about their cookies. I would have preferred an option such as fruit or cheese and crackers. I don't really know what they are thinking with this. I would have given them a 10 if not for the snack issue.",,Solo Leisure,First Class,PDX to LAX,July 2015,5,5,2,4,5,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Jezrel Sabaduquia,11th July 2015,"LAX-SEA on the 737-800. Flew on 4th of July and the atmosphere on-board was festive and friendly. Flight attendants interacted with the passengers. Purser was lovely. The crew was probably one of the best and most friendly I have flown with. They went above and beyond when I realized I had left my jacket at the lounge and made sure I got it back. Seats comfortable with plenty of space for the 2-hour flight. Food and beverage selection was extensive. Excellent snack of pasta with marinara sauce, beans, along with with a salad which was fresh. Overall, a wonderful flight. Good lounge, excellent service, great food and comfortable seats.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,First Class,LAX to SEA,July 2015,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,21st June 2015,"Just returned to the Greatland having flown what is now my favorite airline once again. Departed ANC at 5 am and arrived ontime in SEA. I was bumped up to First due to my Gold status which I appreciate. The service was fine, the plane clean and all in all nothing to complain about. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon, a Q-400. No problems with anything here. If there was one thing though it would be the seats on the Q do not adjust at all. I wish they would but understand why they don't. The return trip was great on both legs. The crew was very impressive with their customer service.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,First Class,ANC to RDM via SEA,June 2015,4,5,4,4,5,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,18th May 2015,Returned recently from a trip to SEA from ANC and SDF (on Am Eagle) to ORD then onto ANC. All flights were well run affairs with fine crews and great service. I flew First and when I get upgraded I always enjoy the experience. I am however more than pleased when I do not move up as the rest of the plane service crew does a fine job. I have yet to be unhappy with this airline since I have returned to using it on all my flights out and back to the Greatland. I have about six more flights scheduled in the next half year and I plan to fly them every time. Please keep it up!,,,First Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,W Campbell,16th May 2015,"Flight 893 9 May. I don't fly Alaska at all as my loyalties are with another airline at present because of frequent flier status. I flew last Saturday night at 9.45pm from Seattle to Oakland. What a difference in customer service. From the very start in the airport - their employees seemed gracious. The agents at the departure gate seemed relaxed and most affable as I watched them before our boarding call. My mainline carrier I usually fly - the employees always seem ""put out"" when they are interrupted from their computers. Inflight was pleasant. Flight attendants who seemed happy. If Alaska Airlines flew where I needed to go - they would have won me over.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,1,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,H Duncan,11th May 2015,Flight AS838 on 6 May. Flew Alaska from Honolulu to Oakland on 6 May. I was not expecting much for the cost of the first class ticket and was pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was not old (737-800) seat was spacious enough for a 5 hour day time flight. Meal was good and a nice linen service. Even the wine served was quite good and topped up regularly if you wished without having to ask. Crew were friendly and efficient. Even check in was quick and efficient. Overall a good experience and I think worth the extra for first class for this length flight. I rate it as highly as some domestic Australian business class flights I've had so it was quite good.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Terk El,27th April 2015,Upgraded to first class for our flight from SEA to DFW. Had seen Tom Douglas in the news lately talking his about the new menu he created for all Alaska flights. Our breakfast going down and dinner coming back was awful looking awful smelling and awful tasting. Many in 1st class that had the dinner on the return did not eat it. Even FA said she was embarrassed to be serving this meal. The spinach had a nasty smell to it.,,,First Class,,,4,4,1,3,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,David Hibbert,27th April 2015,Flew with family SJC-Honolulu then returned to SJC via Seattle. Economy Class. All planes were 737's of some variety. The seats were comfortable with adjustable headrests but legroom was terrible. I'm short so this was only a problem when I (or someone else) wanted to use the restroom as the person on the aisle seat had no choice but to get out of his seat to accommodate us. The cheese platter is an excellent meal available on all flights. Availability of hot meals was inconsistent and confusing (available one direction but not the other on flights before 9 am or after etc.). Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can. We once showed up 20 minutes before our departure time with boarding passes I had printed the night before and the plane had left already! They said they had paged us but we couldn't hear anything in that particular airport. Fortunately they had seats available on the next flight 2 hours later and got us on that for no charge.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,5,4,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,L Green,10th April 2015,Flew First LA to Pueto Vallarta and had several issues. Firstly leg room was the poorest I'd experienced in first class ever. Secondly the cabin was far too cold and no rugs are supplied. Thirdly several passengers were allowed to remain in a reclined seat position for landing a safety issue. Lunch offered no choice - the chicken wedge salad was inedible. Luggage took well over the 20 minutes to arrive on the carousel. I could go on but let's just say I won't be flying with them again.,,,First Class,,,1,1,1,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Pomeranze Peter,4th March 2015,Kona - Oakland First class. What an improvement. Leaving United in the dust Alaska offers good food good service and decent leg room on this sector. Individual meals instead of all at one time distinguish this excellent offering from United using the same aircraft and only one hard working flight attendant. Finally a major carrier steps up and offers good service to and from Hawaii.,,,First Class,,,4,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,P Pomeranze,4th March 2015,Great service Seattle to Kona. Major upgrade in meal entertainment and attitude since last years trip. Keep it up Alaska you won me over.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,S Sasse,24th February 2015,"I recently flew first class from Cancun Mexico to Seattle Washington. Having tried many times to upgrade and not having any luck I was excited that I finally got the chance. My boyfriend and I each used 10000 points to splurge on the trip home. I would never have done so if I knew how poor the service would be. Our steward was beyond rude. He offered no service whatsoever was totally unhelpful with any questions and hung out in the front away from the passengers. We had to ask for more water let alone a drink and when we did his attitude was atrocious. I realize first class isn't what it used to be but had I known what this would have been like I would have saved my points and stayed in coach I've had much better service there! Very disappointing for my first time going ""first class"".",,,First Class,,,4,1,1,5,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Eva Sharp,23rd January 2015,I had never flown Alaska before this past 2014-15 Christmas/New Year season. My fiancé had relocated for work to Portland OR from Massachusetts. We had two cats to move and decided it would be best for them to fly with me in the cabin for the holiday. The operator who booked the flights with my fiancé was so helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed to get the cats ready. When I got to Logan Airport in Boston I was allowed to board early with the cat carriers. When one of my cats started getting antsy in her carrier and I had the carrier in my lap the stewardesses asked if the kitties needed anything. There was no fuss or problems traveling with the cats. Check in was smooth and easy on both going and coming. The Alaska Airlines staff is genuinely friendly and pleasant which is such a change from the canned fake concern most airlines staff seem to have. The mileage club is so easy to use and keep track of miles. It is nice to see that customer service is still a virtue in some companies.,,,Business Class,,,3,5,3,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Valerie Hart,21st January 2015,"Yesterday January 19 2015 I flew Flight 16 from Seattle back to Orlando. It had been a round-about 48 hour visit to an ill relative and I was exhausted from having to rise in the wee hours AM to board coming and going on the only non-stop flight. It has been many years since I have seen flight attendants so ""up-beat"" and kind with a sense of humor in the face of a fully packed jumbo jet. And too many years since I have seen well-groomed stewardesses actively caring for each passenger. Accolades to Alaska Airlines for returning to a more gracious time during these chaotic ones.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,Michael Bohlinger,14th January 2015,Travelled from Philadelphia to Maui via Seattle. Flew first class. After take off flight attendant stated that there were only 16 first class meals on board for the 16 first class seats. There were two choices of menu 8 each. She started taking orders at the front of the first class section and I was setting in the back when she got to me there were no choices left take the remaining selection or nothing. So I end up with nothing. She came back and offered me a cheese platter with 7 grapes and two so so cheeses and some crackers. Seats were standard first class seats which did not come close to lay flat. Hand held entertainment device did not work. Poor excuse for a first class flight.,,,First Class,,,2,2,1,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,11th January 2015,Returned early this morning from my flight Redmond to Seattle to Anchorage on Alaska in First. (upgraded). This flight was fine once we got into the air. Our plane had an issue or two which prevented an on time takeoff. We were about 70 minutes delayed but the crew did a fine job keeping everyone informed and did their usual fine job for the passengers. Paul was our employee in first and did an outstanding job great humor and fantastic work ethic. Even though we were late getting home to the Greatland nobody on board (from what I saw) griped about it. We were just glad to be back home.,,,First Class,,,,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Brian Parker,5th January 2015,Flew LAX-SEA-BLI on B737-900. Took the offer of a first class upgrade for $50. Friendly attentive crew and a meal was served. I always find Alaska good value for the money. The only drawback is the constant PA's telling you how to do everything from how to stow your bag in the overhead to not using the call bell unless it's a medical emergency. All in all though a safe comfortable and reasonably priced service.,,,First Class,,,4,4,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,Mark Wang,5th January 2015,"SEA to IAH return. First time flying on Alaska. Both legs were on time. Service was friendly. I appreciate the communication from the pilot or first officer with respect to turbulence and what's happening with the flight. Leg room was decent for economy class. Not a big fan of their food and beverage selections. Being a bit of a nervous flyer I generally tend to ask for 3 glasses of red wine when drink service is offered so I can slip slowly and make them last for a 4 hour flight and mellow out. One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer). So this aspect was about the only thing that I give a thumbs down to. Another thing I like about some other airlines you have your own IFE system display. For me it's a matter of simply selecting ""My Flight"" as I like to see the progress of the flight. Not possible with Alaska.",,,Economy Class,,,4,3,2,2,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Brian Parker,5th January 2015,Flew BLI-SEA-SNA. Bellingham to Seattle on Horizon Q400. No service offered on this sector. Comfortable flight. Only 45 minute connection time in Seattle however made it to the next gate with ease. Boarded the B737-700 from the tarmac in the cold pouring Seattle rain instead of via an airbridge. Crew were efficient but no smiles or interactions with the passengers. Legroom excellent for economy and seat very comfortable. Really convenient being able to fly into John Wayne airport. I fly with Alaska fairly often and always find their service comfortable reliable and good value for the money.,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Ann Damian,29th December 2014,Left Santa Ana late because plane arrived late. Had connection in Portland and we only had now 5 minutes to get from gate C to lower level gate A. Dozen or so people running to their gates. Luckily for us there were several flyers going to Eugene so the flight was held and even waited for luggage. Thank you Alaska Airlines for making the end of our vacation a happy ending.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,H Dennis,22nd December 2014,SEA-IAH first class 739 equipment. Boarding was fine and efficient. Left about ten minutes late due to catering not being available until last minute. Hit cruise 19 minutes into flight but it was fully an hour before FA served drinks. Nothing unusual going on so this was inexplicable. Service was friendly but very slow.,,,First Class,,,4,3,3,4,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Brian Lally,10th December 2014,Recently traveled for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight from San Diego-Boston. It was the best domestic flight I have experienced. The 4 cabin crew members were excellent and very customer engaged with passengers needs. The flight wasn't full and they came to me and asked if I wanted a row of seats to myself to relax for the duration of the flight. The service was great 3 rounds of snack and beverage service for the 5-hour flight. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 and the legroom was great. A job well done. I look forward to flying onboard in the near future. The only downfall to Alaska Airlines is they charge $10.00 for a video recorder to watch the movies. There should be no charge for that as it should be complimentary since snacks sandwiches and alcohol are charged to the customer.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,3,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,R Cleary,10th December 2014,12/1/14 ORD-SEA Flt 29. Arrived at the airport about 1.5 hours early. Only 1 agent at the counter. Waited about 15 mins before another agent appeared to assist. Once there it went smoothly and quickly. Boarding was efficient and able to be seated quickly. We were issued their digiplayers. Fair selection of movies to view but really no place to put the player when the meal arrived. A bit cumbersome. Meal offered was one choice only. It was tasty but portions have certainly been scaled back. Flight attendant disappeared after the meal service. Arrived on time. However I remember Alaska having a far superior service to that of its rivals but this flight did not prove that at all.,,,First Class,,,3,1,3,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,3,R Cleary,10th December 2014,12/4/14 SEA to ORD Flt 22. When checking in one has to perform a self bag tag and then take the luggage to the check in desk. There were 2 of us - we had 1 bag to check. It was over by 4lbs but since you are allowed two pieces of luggage per person we were well with in the weight limit. Too bad cost $75. Flight departed on time. Staff were friendly service was standard. Same meal offered on both segments but yet again nothing remarkable that would make me select this carrier over the competition. Once meal was served and one refresher of drinks the FA disappeared. I was disappointed with the overall service. It is not what I was accustomed to. A digiplayer for the entertainment was handed out but it is cumbersome to have on your tray table when the meal is served.,,,First Class,,,3,2,3,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,8,S Koenig,4th December 2014,SEA-LAX. Standard seating food etc for a 2.5 hour flight. As first class has an advantage over others in that you get access to their airline club even if you are flying just domestic and not connecting to an international flight (and aren't a club member). Alaska has both refundable and non-refundable first class fares. Non-refundable is about 1/2 the cost of the refundable but is not available on all routes (e.g. we were going to fly to BUR but only fc fare was refundable so we chose to fly to LAX instead).,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,L Haubert,1st December 2014,Traveled first class San Diego to Boston on 11/20/14. Plane left on time clean friendly flight attendants good breakfast and service and champagne. No complaints and felt it worth the money.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,D Parker,11th November 2014,Flew one of the Alaska/Horizon regional routes PDX-MFR night flight. The flight was originally at 9.05-ish but was delayed to 9.55. Got info 3 hours ahead of time and we still boarded late because traffic on the taxiway. Once aboard seats were fairly comfy flight attendants were friendly easily accommodated my sister's severe nut allergy made sure no nut-containing items were aboard the plane (standard airline safety procedure) and served two drinks for a flight less than an hour. Not bad Alaska.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,M Bockstruck,28th October 2014,Flew Alaska MCI to SEA return in First. Both legs were pleasant but the service on the outbound leg got off to a slow start with no pre-take off beverage offered. However once we were in the air the flight attendant was very quick to begin beverage service. Seats were comfortable but the pitch was a little tight I wish Alaska would invest in some bigger planes for their longer cross country flights in order to have a larger First Class cabin. Food was very good served plated and fresh. Check In both in Kansas City and Seattle was extremely easy and the Board Room in Seattle was pleasant. For a full fare ticket it wasn't an overall bad experience but felt that I overpaid slightly for what I got. Will fly Alaska First again in December and am looking forward to gaining elite status with them. Their mileage earning partnerships cannot be beat and I love that I can fly Delta American British Airways and Emirates as needed and still earn miles.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,A Bastien,28th October 2014,10-12-14 early flight SMF to SEA. Seats were thin but comfortable legroom seemed a bit more generous than the space I'm used to on other carriers seats had power outlets. I flew Alaska as part of a Delta flight from SMF- SEA-DTW-TVC the ticket purchased with my spouse's frequent flyer miles. I would choose to fly Alaska again over another airline even if the ticket price was higher. The aircraft didn't have entertainment. The food selection looked decent although I didn't buy any.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,1,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Schrier Michael,12th October 2014,Flew from SFO to ANC to SFO with stopover in SEA on 5th and 13th September 2014. These were routine flights. There were no delays in fact each leg was a few minutes ahead of schedule and baggage came out in the first few minutes. The Champagne and Beer was cold the food was really just snacks as we travelled in between normal mealtimes. This was good value as we were allowed 2 pieces of luggage each. I would definitely recommend this airline.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,3,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,1st October 2014,My wife and I travelled to SEA and return to ANC recently on Alaska. No issues at all problem wise. Both flights were fine crews were great lanes clean on time arrivals etc. I tried to upgrade to First as I am a MVP Gold member but alas no luck. Maybe next time. I told my spouse it is a nice experience and she was hoping to see it firsthand. Anyhow keep up the good work and thanks Alaska.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,K Homestead,1st October 2014,Took Alaska to Cabo on Sept 15th Alaska stated flight is still going. Get to San Diego Cabo flight still going. 30 minutes later our flight is cancelled. Alaska says no seats open back to Seattle tough luck. Find out the Cabo airport was shut down the day before and Alaska flew us to San Diego knowing this.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,,E Jones,14th September 2014,I had a flight scheduled from ATL-SEA and the day of it was cancelled. So just four hours before my flight I was scrambling to get another flight that day.. Not only that but they didn't even send an alert that the flight was cancelled. My google alerts notified me about the cancellation. The customer service is non-existent and I will never book with them again. Book at your own risk!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,9th September 2014,Returned last week from a ANC-SEA-ATL and return in First. No complaints with the flights at all. As usual (for me) the service was outstanding the planes clean and the flight crews were very friendly. We were told we would be departing ATL about an hour late due to a crew rest issue. This would cause me to miss my connection to ANC in Seattle. I was rebooked quickly by the ATL folks. I caught my flight with minutes to spare in SEA but of course my bag did not show until the next flight. The Alaska employee at baggage claim was tired and a bit grumpy but I was given a coupon for 2500 miles and that was fine with me. Besides this issue all was great. Looking forward to our next flight to SEA this Thursday evening.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Judith Mihaere,1st September 2014,We have just arrived back in New Zealand after our Alaskan cruise and would like to commend Alaska Airlines customer service desk for their excellent and sympathetic response to out late arrival due to tardy shuttle service resulting in our late arrival at LAX airport. We were very stressed as were to travel to Seattle the staff member advised that although our flight hadn't quite left it was indeed too late to get on but immediately advised that they had a flight every hour and could get us on the next flight. After all this there was no extra charges for this change we were so impressed with that.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,D Smith,1st September 2014,Alaska is our airline of choice. MCI-SEA-ANC flights generally good and on time. New Sky interior slimline Recaro seats (a bit uncomfortable). On landing at Anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt (squeal on the brakes hard stop) then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around. ANC-SEA-MCI late flight out of ANC substituted a smaller plane which put us in a non-recline seat. All in all we have been satisfied with Alaska and will continue to use them as these are somewhat minor issues and tend to be found on all airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,4,Amanda Miller,28th August 2014,My first flight from Vancouver to Seattle was great - the crew were fantastic. However my flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City was not very enjoyable. I found the crew to be lazy and rude. I tried to order a beverage on the plane and they had closed out early (1 hour early) and right after they had passed with the drink cart. I've flown before and unless there is turbulence then typically a plane will serve you until about 30 minutes before landing. One flight attendant was very rude. I usually love flying Alaska and was about to apply for my Alaska Air credit card but this was very disappointing. I think I may hold back on applying because of this particular experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,2,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Joseph Hammer,28th August 2014,I flew Alaska non-stop from Dallas to Portland first class. The crew were very friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. We had an hour delay after boarding the aircraft in Dallas but the crew kept everybody informed and kept serving drinks and a small snack for us. Very impressed with their first class service.,,,First Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,J Briolat,28th August 2014,"Recently flew on Alaska Airlines with my 2 longer legs (TUS to SEA and ANC to PDX) in First Class. On these flights (along with the other 2 segments) the flight and flight crew were fine. My complaint is with what defines ""First Class"" to Alaska Airlines. On TUS-SEA our meal consisted of a chicken sandwich and a chocolate mint! No inflight entertainment devices provided. On the ANC-PDX segment (which was 2.45 Alaska time to 7am PDX time). No wake-up breakfast which meant zero food provided at all. Flight attendant asked if we wanted anything as we were already in the process of pre-landing operations. And since an overnight flight no inflight entertainment. Guess I'm expecting too much for paying for a first class seat.",,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,2,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,K Plachta,28th August 2014,"Flying from Soldotna AK we were fogged in. In only takes a short while for fog to burn off but they delayed the flight twice and then canceled it. I had the option to either have a 12 hour layover in Anchorage or spend the night in Seattle's airport. After waiting 3 hours I was flown to Anchorage. I had 100lbs of frozen fish I worked hard catching. Alaska air refused to help in any way. No mailing my fish home no putting it in a freezer. They refused to put me in a hotel to sleep no options whatsoever. I called them and the woman told me ""We can't pick up the tab for every act of God"" and ""this happens all the time."" Once in Anchorage I tried to switch to the flight where I stay overnight in Seattle because someone I knew had a freezer and I could stay there. Customer service said 1 seat was left while asking her supervisor permission the seat was taken. I took the next flight 4 hours later only to find out the freezer was unavailable so late at night. So I was sent by customer service to get my fish from baggage (it was checked) then come back. I did and asked again to change to the plan to layover 12 hours in Anchorage. I went and waited in line again. I got my fish into the freezer in Anchorage for 28$ not bad but I shouldn't have to pay for that. 3 hours in Soldotna 12 hours in Anchorage a red-eye flight to Seattle then another 3 hour lay-over until my next flight home which is only a 2.5 hour drive. I was so exhausted. I can't believe this happens all the time and everyone lets them get away with this.",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,A Forsythe,26th August 2014,This week on my trip to Seattle I flew Alaska Airlines when in the past I would normally fly United. Alaska Airlines far exceeded my expectations. If I could use them to fly everywhere I would. The flight attendants actually seemed happy and were very nice. The seats were extremely comfortable - much more comfortable than other flights that I've been on. The plane was clean. I will definitely fly with Alaska Airlines anytime I can.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Tom Eichenberg,18th August 2014,We flew from Maui to Seattle with a connection in Seattle to Washington D.C. First the plane leaving Maui was delayed for over 3 hours. Alaska Airlines took us off our connecting flight without telling us (Seattle to D.C.) and booked us on a much later flight. Thank goodness I checked before departing from Maui. I was told that they didn't think there would be enough time to make the connection. I asked for them to get me on another flight/airline where I wasn't waiting for my connection for five or more hours. They couldn't do this I was told. I demanded to be put back on the earlier connection and told them I would attempt to make the connection although I had less than 30 minutes to do so. I was told that my seats were already taken by someone else. I informed them that tickets had been given to me already for my seats and they had better get me back on that plane. After some time they did get me back onto the connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. The plane from Maui to Seattle took off several hours late and it did not have very good air conditioning. The plane was hot poor service and I was not impressed at all with Alaska Airlines. I will never fly with them again. The connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. was also very hot on the plane. Don't fly Alaska Airways. Go with another carrier such as United Delta or American Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,3,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Tymoshenko Yevgeniy,5th August 2014,Flight was supposed to depart at 1.30pm from Seattle to Long Beach but it didn't. For the first hour the flight was delayed because one of the aircraft crew was late” Then we were told the flight was delayed for another 3 hours. I could not wait any longer. I requested to be put on another available flight to California. I was placed on flight # 464Y Seattle to Los Angeles with departure time at 7.25 pm. I wasted 6 hours of my time and I had to pay an extra fee to rent a car from LAX area and pay with higher rate. I arrived in a hotel at 11.30 pm. The trip to Long Beach took me 12 hours instead of 5 hours. I would be OK with this if the flight back to Seattle had not been canceled too. Flight 3477 from Long Beach to Seattle with departure time at 7.25 pm was canceled because of some engine problems. At 11.00 pm I was told that the aircraft would not be fixed any soon and all hotels around Long Beach and LAX were booked. I had to take a taxi to LAX and had to sleep on the bench in LAX airport so I could finally fly to Seattle on the 6am flight. It was the worst experience in flight and I am flying for business a lot.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,7,P Sawyers,2nd August 2014,Flew LAX to DCA. Delay leaving LAX due to air traffic congestion but was kept informed. The seats were pretty uncomfortable considering this was a 5+ hours flight. I was very glad that I purchased a 'comfort seat' alongside as I was coming off a 15 hour flight from Australia and had space to spread out. The cabin crew were lovely and most helpful. We had a strange delay in DCA as we arrived 2 hours late due to earlier delay and adverse weather around DC and the Alaska gate was taken by another Alaska plane and we ended up waiting around 30 minutes on the tarmac for space to be found. Would use them again but would definitely purchase the comfort seat for added space.,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,3,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Daun Frederickson,2nd August 2014,We traveled home from Las Vegas on Tuesday July 29. Our plane was 4.5 hours late and I cannot say enough how great the Alaska Airline staff were . They were very helpful apologetic and kept us informed the entire time on what the updates were on our flight and when we could expect to take off. We really appreciated the positive attitude and genuine care of their employees. It made the inconvenience of having to wait for our flight much easier and very helpful.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,2nd August 2014,Just returned from my trip south ANC-SEA-EUG and returned EUG-PDX-ANC. All flights were fine the crews were all professional clean aircraft on time and the food was quite decent. We had quite a few young children flying back to Alaska with their parents from 3 months of age up to five in my section. The flight attendants were very helpful and appeared to enjoy the interaction with the little ones. I flew the 400 model combi south for the first time. Not bad at all for a red eye flight. All in all a fine experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Kaldate Rajesh,29th July 2014,July 24th. Flew SLC-SFO in the morning and returned the same evening. Best short haul domestic experience this year. Boarding handled smoothly. Flight crew extremely polite and courteous. Cabin nice clean and the temp. Was well controlled. Both flights on perfect time. Will try to fly more with Alaska if possible.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,1,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Ramona Tyma,20th July 2014,Flew from Orlando on 5/29/14. Flying from Tampa to Seattle on 8/9/14 and returning on 8/31/14. Crew were attentive friendly and a pleasure to spend 5.5 hours with. Food was fresh warm and tasty. I am so happy they added round trip non-stop Tampa to Seattle. Absolutely perfect for me.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,A Santiago,12th July 2014,PHX-SEA and back. The crew signed my Alaska Airlines history book they all chatted with me and seemed in good spirits. The flight was handled smoothly and the drinks and food was generous considering what we got was being offered free (sandwiches however cost 6 dollars on economy class).,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,Sukasem Tejatanalert,8th July 2014,Flew from Los Angeles to Anchorage on Alaska 149. The flight left and arrived in destination on time. The purchase food quality and quantity were OK. The drinks provided during the flight are more than adequate. The service was nice.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,S Morse,6th July 2014,Plane delayed due to mechanical trouble. So they re-routed another flight and changed the direction of the flight and the stops although still ending up in Seattle where we were headed. So instead of leaving around 11am we left more like at 4pm. At our first stop in Wrangel some people got on. Then some more. Then a few more. After a while the crew started counting passengers. Then did it again. And again. Then they started asking names as well as counting. Then did that again. And again. And again. As far as I could tell they never found any trouble and never made anyone leave the plane. Then they said we were overweight and had to unload some fuel. After that they started counting and naming again. When I asked if they be serving dinner since it was now after 4 and we wouldn't get to Seattle until after at least 9 pm they said they had 4 wraps on board to sell. The CSA then came on the plane and yelled at me for delaying the plane! For asking if we'd get fed! More than an hour after that harangue we left. We arrived in Seattle around 1 am hungry.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,23rd June 2014,ANC to SLC return in First both directions. I have no complaints whatsoever. The food was fine the service was excellent on-time both directions and the plane was clean. Their SLC growth (# of flights to and from there) has not affected their great customer service negatively as far as I could tell. One thing which was different on the return flight though was that the flight attendant came around prior to our landing and thanked each customer for flying with Alaska and I felt she meant it. It was a small but very classy thing to do as I have never seen this before. It is the small but kind gestures that help make a difference when I fly. Keep it up Alaska!,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,P Miller,9th June 2014,PSP-PDX-LAX. Two flights with Alaska both of which were on time departures and arrivals. Friendly cabin crew adequate legroom. All in all a good experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,John Logan,4th June 2014,In May I flew with the airline three times: San Francisco to Seattle at the start of my visit then a return flight at the end. In between I flew from Palm Springs to Seattle with the airline. All were good and timely. My main comments are words of praise for the check-in team at Seattle at the start of my return flight when they worked long and diligently to ensure my luggage in the hold was correctly tagged directly back to my home airport in Perth Australia for that 21-hour flight via Hong Kong.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,B Bachman,1st June 2014,I flew from Seattle to Anchorage on a 737-800 with the new slimline Recaro seats. Each seat had a power outlet with a USB port and the seats were very comfy with an adjustable head rest and more legroom compared to the old seats. I noticed that there was no longer a barrier between first class and coach but maybe they will install it later. I had 30 minutes of free Wi-Fi thanks to a partnership with Allstate. I tested the speed at 2 Mb/sec download and 0.25 Mb/sec upload. I rented an entertainment player for $8 and had time to watch a movie along with a few other clips. The devices are a little slow and touchy but are still functional. Soon Alaska Airlines will offer entertainment on your own iPads laptops etc. I purchased the chicken dinner for $6 which consisted of boneless chicken breast mashed potatoes and green beans and actually tasted very good. The drink cart went around 2 times during the 3 hour flight and the second time I had delicious orange Tazo tea. Overall a great experience with great service all around!,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,29th May 2014,Just back from my 3 week tour of the Lower 48 using Alaska from ANC-SEA-ATL return in First. All aspects of my various flights went smoothly. Very enjoyable experience. Flight crews were attentive clean aircraft arrival times early on most of the flights and the food was quite good as well. No complaints at all. Heading south again in two weeks to SCL. Looking forward to the Alaskan Experience once again.,,,First Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Jim Fitzgerald,25th May 2014,My Wife and I have used various Airlines in USA fairly extensively over the years. First time on Alaskan and can only highly recommend them. Service from check in Kerbside to arrival destination was perfect and should ever we visit USA again will use them if opportunity exists.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,7th May 2014,Just back from a trip from ANC to Portland then SMF and return. We departed about 40 minutes late from ANC due to a switch issue but made up for it enroute. We had a medical emergency also but the passenger was given oxygen and was well cared for by the crew. Horizon provided the flight south to Sacramento and that was fine in all regards. The trip back was nearly perfect. My only issue is the waiting room in Portland it is a zoo! Otherwise - great!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Jason Burnie,1st May 2014,Flew SEA to SAN in April. Absolutely flawless. Check in was simple and hassle free. Once onboard all cabin crew were so pleasant. Repeated drinks service throughout the flight. One passenger taken ill the crew were reaching out for doctors onboard and they also stood by. Plenty of legroom in economy. Aircraft 737-800 seemed brand new. Interior was clean and fresh. Baggage was on the belt in no time despite it was a short walk from the gate to the belt. Absolutely on top of my choice among American carriers.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Frank Hilton,23rd April 2014,I flew Palm Springs to Portland. We departed Palm Springs 5.5 hours late due to a wind/dust storm. The crew were fantastic. We were on and off the plane a couple of times. The passengers never got cranky because of the high degree of professionalism and good vibes from the crew. I have never had a bad flight on Alaska and it is always my first choice.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Stephen G Sweet,22nd April 2014,"Returned last week from my annual trip to Reno from ANC. The flight out was fine good service clean plane and landed a few minutes early in SEA. The flight to RNO was great on Horizon good crew with great service. The only complaint I have are the gates at Portland for the ""Seattle Shuttle"" are pretty crammed together and I accidentally tried to board the wrong flight. The gate agent pointed this out to me and was a bit short attitude wise. I asked about how many flights are leaving at 3.30? She said ""one at that time and the one you are on starts to board at that time and leaves at 4! I was not the only person who had this issue but no problem after that. I got to SEA and the flight home to ANC was fine. I will be flying them again this next Monday going to SMF. I expect my flights will be fine.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Karl Moosbrugger,21st April 2014,SEA-KOA my first ever flight with Alaska. Check-in at SEA was quick and efficient. Onboard I was positively surprised by the seat pitch; much more leg room than on most other airlines (and I am quite tall). Flight itself was partly bumpy due to weather but the crew cheered everyone up with free Mai Tais shortly before reaching Hawaii. Never had that with any other airline. Flight was on time the food for purchase was OK. Overall a very good experience. Will certainly use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Trevor Kowbel,13th April 2014,My first experience with Alaska Airlines. I didn't expect the level of service from the stewards onboard. My two young sons myself and my wife traveled from Edmonton to Seattle and then to Honolulu. The stewards dealing with objectionable passengers children running up and down the aisle were professional and polite. I was able to extend my legs into the aisle without being harassed to remove them. On return bad weather delayed our connection.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,G Gifari,13th April 2014,Flew on Flight 447 from LAX to SEA. Codeshare with Qantas. Plane was modern but interior looked dreadfully tiresome. For a low cost carrier their seat pitch was amazing. Cabin crew friendly and engaging with passengers. Besides the typical buy-on-board they give you something for your metabolism and non-alcoholic beverages are complementary. I ordered one of their buy-on-board but the crew forgot to serve it to me even though they have charged my card and all. Thus they ran out on that option after serving it to all the other passengers. Cabin crew's apologies were sincere and they did their best to make it up for me.,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,3,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Laura Nathanson,6th April 2014,Flew first class from JFK to San Diego flight 769 on April 1. And it did feel like an April Fool return to 1955. No pocket with safety info and sick bag no blankets or pillows provided stewardesses never once went through to collect trash. Food was allergy-unfriendly with bowl of mixed nuts for appetizer and a nut topped parfait for dessert. Worst of all though was the feeling of no safety consciousness. The two stewardesses functioned as - hostesses. Three young men each kept coming up repeatedly to ask a question use the bathroom get a soft drink. The boys would stay in the food prep area for several minutes chatting and then linger in the first class cabin to perform stretching exercises. On all other airlines that I've been on this kind of thing is just unheard of. I would not fly this airline again.,,,First Class,,,5,1,1,,,,no
Alaska Airlines,5,M Gephart,28th March 2014,Rebooked onto Alaska due to cancellation of my original flight on UA from SEA to LAX. The aircraft was pretty worn (737-400) and the IFE non-existent. The legroom was frightening. Once the pax in front of me reclined my knees were against his seat for the duration. Cabin crew were good and service was perfunctory. However I could've done without the 5 minute announcement ploy for their credit card and corresponding benefits (not to mention the FA walking down the aisle with applications). Got me from point to point but I have to say I wasn't really that impressed.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,1,,,no
Alaska Airlines,,M Tighe,3rd March 2014,Had our reservations with other connecting flights and rental cars for 3 days on Oahu and 7 days on Maui this coming June. We were very excited! Then we checked our itineraries and Alaska Airlines cancelled our return flight #883. Alaska re-booked our Honolulu departure 12 hours earlier but we would not get back from Maui to catch it until 8 hours later. They gave us 2 choices: the earlier flight or full refund. Very nice Alaska especially considering the inter island flight is non-cancellable nor are the rental cars etc. Since we made non- cancellable tickets and obtained a confirmation from Alaska I will not ever trust them again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Bastien Antoine,17th February 2014,February 1 2014. Flight 381 from SEA (Seattle) to SMF (Sacramento). I paid the extra $50 for a first class upgrade. The upgrade was worth the $50.00 although leg room wasn't what I would have expected (I was in 1D behind the bulkhead). The food and complimentary wine were good the service competent. I would recommend Alaska based on my first class travel experience.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,1,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,T Osterman,17th February 2014,I am an Alaska Gold 75K and due to all the flight time I am seeing an increasing amount of maintenance holds delays and flight impact due to demand maintenance. On a flight from SEA to PSP that was on gate hold for 30 minutes due to a cockpit printer malfunction. The pilots PA circuit also malfunctioned with very loud audio noise in the background that made his communication to the cabin almost inaudible. Given the monthly frequency of gate hold maintenance events I am seeing as a passenger I am concerned about the competency funding and oversight of their maintenance program.,,,First Class,,,2,3,2,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,M Marshall,20th January 2014,Seattle-Kodiak-Seattle. Very nice trip. Airline personnel were friendly and efficient. Only minor complaint is that the seats hardly tip back.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Mauricio Perez,29th December 2013,I flew from San Jose California to Seattle. The service was ok the plane was on-time. Boarding was delayed 2 mins but we arrived in Seattle 15 minutes before schedule. Two weeks later I flew from Seattle to Los Angeles - it was a connecting flight perfect again. The service of the crew members were good the flight was on-time again and no problems with the baggage. It went directly to my final destination (Guadalajara Mexico). Both aircraft's were Boeing 737-900 they were very clean and comfortable the legroom was ok. If I can I will fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,3,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Garone Remo,20th December 2013,June 2013. One flight from LAX to SEA and another a few days later from ANC to LAX. Friendly and professional crew (on board and at the airport) modern aircraft (B737-800 and B737-900/ER) departure and arrival on time luggage recovered 5 minutes after arrival. I would say only one thing: Next time I will fly with Alaska Airlines again! An excellent low cost company.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,S Sparks,19th December 2013,"I have been flying Alaska for many years. For the last several years I have been flying first class only and have been very satisfied with the food the service and the extra space. This last trip though made me wonder if I should continue to pay the substantial difference in price to be in first class. It was the space in the new plane. The space between me and the seat in front is closer. I had to struggle to get my bag under the seat in front of me when the passenger in front of me had his seat back. I'm 5'5' and 125 lbs. Also there used to be three big spaces under the 1st class seats for two people. Now there are two with one other smaller space big enough to fit a purse maybe. I don't like to use the overhead but I can change. There still seemed to be plenty of space between me and the passenger next to me. I like the three moveable light fixtures and the ability to direct air flow on the ceiling better. The food is still good and the service good. Although staff service on the majority of my flights has been ""excellent"" I can only honestly rate this last trip as ""fair."" I am grateful to her though for this information. I heard her tell the two passengers in front of me that staff call the new planes ""slaveships"" because there are 44 more seats (!) but no more staff (still 4) to serve passengers. She said something to the effect of ""I feel sorry for the people in back. They get served so late or barely at all."" I'm thinking that on my next trip coming up shortly I will go coach one way just to see if I can still justify paying the difference in price. But thanks to the overheard words of the staff attendant I will sit in the middle or closer to the front in coach so that I will get better service and won't have to wait forever. I will also plan to bring on board some food and a beverage. Overall I really like Alaska although I haven't flown any others for a long time. Maybe I will venture onto another airline just to compare. I never have trouble checking in no lost luggage airport gate staff friendly and professional. There are a lot of things I like about Alaska.",,,First Class,,,4,3,5,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Leah Gomez,16th December 2013,My time on Alaska airlines was ok. I was flying from Sacramento California to Seattle Washington. The flight attendants were nice and cheerful. The flight left on time and the flight attendants gave us a bag of beef jerky for the inflight meals. We ended up landing about 10 minutes early and the only thing I recommend is that they add inflight entertainment otherwise I recommend that you fly with Alaska.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,3,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Dale Becker,9th December 2013,I often fly on Alaska/Horizon flights between Montana and Seattle or Portland. My overall experiences have been very good. Flights even in winter have been on time and counter and plane staff have always been excellent. Value is very good compared with the few other carriers (Delta and United) that we have to choose from here in Montana. Seats on Alaska planes could be more comfortable as they are small and fairly stiff and uncomfortable but most flights are short so it is not a big issue for me. You can't carry on larger bags on the smaller planes but their a la cart process still allows me not to have to check in my carry on and pick it up after landing. Overall my satisfaction with Alaska is very good.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,2,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,R Leahy,3rd December 2013,Absolutely awful service. I missed a flight to Honolulu for business because my connecting flight (also an Alaska Airlines flight) was 25 minutes late arriving. I got to the departure gate for Honolulu in time to see the plane sit there for a few minutes before pushing back if only they have held the plane 5-10min so me and the half dozen other connecting passengers could make the flight. Worse yet they offered no hotel or even club accommodations even thought this was the last flight out and it was entirely the airline's fault that we didn't make the connection—service reps said it wasn't their problem since they were 'only' 20min late and blamed my booking. I'll never fly Alaska Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,T Shant,2nd December 2013,LAX-YVR-LAX. On the flight to YVR we were greeted with great service at the gate. The aircraft was nice and clean and had a lot of legroom on the B737-400. Even though we were delayed a bit we still had a good flight. The service was great. We had complimentary drinks and the food a cheese plate was delicious and was worth the $7 dollar price. On the flight out to LAX we were delayed from 6am to 11.45am due to maintenance issues. Because of this they rebooked all of the people traveling to Mexico and the first class passengers. They also gave $40 breakfast vouchers. This proves excellent service. Also the first officer took us on a tour of the cockpit which was really nice. Since so many people left this flight onto a flight to Mexico the flight was almost empty. The seats were very comfortable on the Boeing 737-400 and the food and service were great as well especially because they were handing out every order for free due to the delay. Because of this Alaska Airlines is a great airline and I definitely recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,J Dickinson,27th November 2013,Round trip Seattle to Fort Lauderdale family of 4 for a cruise Nov 8 return 16th. Great experience considering we go in with low expectations our own food iPads etc. I was watching the on-time performance for a few weeks prior to departure and it seems this flight leaves the gate early more often than being on-time and our experience was no different - we pushed off 10-15 mins early both coming and going. Crew were experienced polite and helpful. 3 drink cart visits for the 6 hour flight with in-between bottled water. Gate checked our carry-ons for free. All good.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,David Iles,4th November 2013,Seattle - Redmond - Seattle 26 Oct. This year chose to fly rather than drive and good decision. Easy check in at Seattle plane on time and boarding very efficient. Whilst short fly cabin crew were excellent and arriving at Redmond was a delight only plane on ramp and backs in 6/7 mins. Return flight equally as good with on time departure and great team on board. Would certainly choose Alaska again based upon my recent experiences.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,David Iles,4th November 2013,Long Beach - Seattle Friday 25 Oct. An excellent experience with Alaska check in at Long Beach was easy and the flight boarded on time for an on time departure. The cabin crew were excellent throughout the flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Caroline Scandura,25th October 2013,Very pleasant flight that I expect to make frequently visiting daughter in Bend Oregon. Friendly and helpful staff: Went back to plane to recover my jacket. But I have 2 complaints: Elderly neighbor got a $65 ticket when he pulled over in the loading zone to answer my call on his cell (that I was late) and Alaska's Seattle wait room sure looked shabby. Otherwise a very good experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,25th October 2013,Recently returned from ANC-ATL-ANC in first class. I was quite pleased overall with not only the service attitudes of the cabin crew but also the layout of the B-900. The flights were all on time and the food was actually quite good. The crew from ANC to SEA (red-eye) was great with a flair for humor. I do not always travel upfront unfortunately but decided to give it a go wish I could do it every flight. No complaints here. I will continue to use Alaska.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,J Simister,25th October 2013,I have flown several times with Alaskan Airlines over the past few years. I am Canadian and live 2.5 hrs from Spokane Washington. I have found all employees to be polite and helpful over the phone at check-in or while flying. I did have a flight delay in January but all passengers were kept informed of what was going on. I much prefer Alaskan Air over Air Canada. I will be flying with Alaskan again on Nov 6/13 to Hawaii.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,D Bergevin,23rd October 2013,Round trip Seattle to Houston. Everything as expected on time friendly crew arrived back in Seattle 30 minutes early. Have flown Alaska at least once a year for the past 10 years have never had a late flight or lost luggage. Companion fare is a great deal $99.00 + tax anywhere they fly. If you don't like the seats in back quit whining and pony up the money to sit up front.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,D Sirias,20th October 2013,My main issue is the check in. Flight from SMF to PDX was on the small propeller jet. Those do not have overhead room for normal overhead luggage. But they don't tell you. Hence you are forced to tag bags at the gate and place on cart for checking just like regular checked bags. What if you had something temperature sensitive. It's stupid not to inform customers that the plane does not have normal overhead storage. On the return flight it took half hour to check bags because the airline was understaffed line oppressively long. If I fly Alaska again I will bring a backpack only that's sure to fit in the tiny overhead compartment. Tell us if we get normal overhead. That's all I ask.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,,,,no
Alaska Airlines,10,S Conlon,13th October 2013,I've flown close to 50000 miles this year - all on Alaska Airlines. I've been flying Alaska for 15 plus years. Most of my travel is up and down the west coast with a NY Boston Orlando Chicago trip thrown in on occasion. Overall Alaska has done an amazing job all around. I've had one bag go missing in the last 15 years. It showed up at my door before 8 am the next morning. The food choices are excellent in coach and the few times I've been in First Class it's been wonderful. Their beverage choices are extensive and you can purchase an entertainment system on flights over 2 hours. Alaska's flight attendants are great - very friendly and accommodating and most of them have a great sense of humor! The few times I've had to fly other airlines I've discovered there is no comparison.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,C Obryant,10th October 2013,I had not flown with Alaska Airlines for a number of years but had a good experience previously. I had a 6 leg trip this past week from LAX to ANC to FAI to Cordova to JNU and to SIT then finally to SEA. Every trip was on time or ahead of schedule. FA were attentive and polite. F&B service was good. I had the food purchase options on 2 flights and was very pleased. Not overly priced and was fresh with good flavor. Only downside was in LAX boarding was chaotic. Gate agent shows up 5 minutes before boarding so many confused passengers. On all flights I noticed the upholstery on the seats were quite worn. A little surprised when most flight were on 737-700 or 800 series aircraft. Anyway all in all a successful trip with Alaska Airlines. Flights on time and my baggage made every flight. I would certainly endorse Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Stephen G Sweet,1st October 2013,Recently flew Alaska from Anchorage to SEA and then down to Redmond OR to take our daughter to college. The trip down was fine in all respects good service new 737-900 and on time. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon and they did fine as well. The return trip was Redmond to Portland then up to Anchorage again no problems. We departed a bit late from Portland due to a windshield wiper problem but due to the upper level winds due to the massive rainstorm in Portland we were just a few minutes late arriving in ANC. All in all good job all the way around by all crews and staff. I will fly them shortly to ATL and we will see how they do in First.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,P Pomeranze,24th September 2013,I was not looking forward to 6 hours in a 737 from Seattle to Kona in first. In actuality the trip was not bad at all. Decent leg room and meal service were all complemented by a hard working and friendly flight attendant who serviced 20 people on her own. Digi player was decently loaded for entertainment. By today's lowered standards this flight was quite nice.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Krishnan Vaitheeswaran,15th September 2013,SEA-ANC-SEA KTN-JNU JNU-ANC-HNL in B737s during the month of August. Managed to get a Row 6 seat in each of them which led to being offered priority boarding. Every flight was either on time or ahead of schedule. Excellent in-flight service. This is an exceptional American carrier in the north-west of the country. Being slugged twice for baggage despite travelling on a single itinerary was the sole gripe.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Simon Adlam,5th September 2013,LAX-PDX. Very good early morning flight to PDX. Cabin a little tired and cramped but service was some of the best. The breakfast was actually really good - eggs benedict and bloody mary's. First time flying them and would again. They need to upgrade there interior product though as looks worn.,,,First Class,,,3,5,5,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,D Silvey,28th August 2013,Flights Bellingham to Honolulu in Coach. Seats are tight but that's the sign of the times. Service was sparse. You are nickeled and dimed on everything now. Gone are the days of Wardair. Guess that's why they aren't in business. Miss the days when air flight was fun. Having said that out flights we good and we didn't really expect much more for the price we paid. Would take this trip with Alaska Air again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,3,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,B Bachman,26th August 2013,Upgraded to First Class from JNU to ANC for $50 (1.5 hour flight). This was my 1st First Class experience and I was not impressed. Water was offered before take off. The plane was a slightly aged 737-400. At first the seats seem okay but they hardly recline and there is no adjustable headrests. This makes the seats unsuitable for sleeping in. There was also a lot less legroom than I was expecting. I wouldn't recommend putting a bag under the seat in front of you unless it is very small. Since it was morning we were served breakfast. Our drinks were served first along with the standard snack bag that's also served in coach. Then the meals were served. The meal was an egg and bacon French toast sandwich. It was okay but not very filling. I was expecting more for first class.,,,First Class,,,2,4,2,,,2,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Richard Wooden,22nd August 2013,Horrible experience transferring from Flight 456 arriving in Los Angeles to Flight 4213 going to San Jose CA. Boarding pass said Skywest but it was actually American Eagle. On arrival at LAX there was no information about either Skywest no indication where it was located and no one who seemed to know. Asked a gate agent who told us it was terminal 8. She did not say it was American Eagle we were looking for. After much walking and asking several people a TSA agent said to go to gate 65 and take shuttle bus to American. Upon reaching American we were told to board another bus which took us to a building near but not even attached to terminal 8. The TSA agent and the individual opening the restricted zone for us at gate 65 along with the shuttle bus drivers were the only competent individuals who seemed to know that Skywest was American Eagle in this case.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,4,Myrna Gilbert,18th August 2013,Out of 6 flights on Alaska going from Santa Barbara to Kalispell Montana and back only one flight (S.B. to Portland) was even remotely on time. All the rest departed from a half to full hour after the scheduled time. This is the worst this experienced long time flyer has ever seen.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,10,G Cueto,11th August 2013,Exceptional flight from PHL to SEA on Aug 6th. Everything from checking in online using the mobile app to the inflight experience was smooth cheerful and efficient. The new recaro seats in Y class was smartly designed and comfortable as Y class goes. Inflight crew were cheerful and chatty particularly the senior attendant. Virgin America has great amenities on transcon flights but I find Alaska to offer the best service!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,B Bachman,8th August 2013,Flew from Bethel AK to Anchorage AK on a 737-400 Combi. Flight left on time and service was great. Flight attendants were very nice and smiled. I purchased a Mediterranean Tapas picnic pack for $6 and it was very good. A couple of days later flew from Anchorage AK to Juneau AK on a lei themed 737-800 which is rare for the route (usually only 737-400s are flown). It was nice having an adjustable headrest but I noticed that the seats on the 737-800 don't recline as much as the seats on the older 737-400. The flight was pretty empty with only 50 passengers. The flight attendants seemed tired and didn't smile as much but the service was still okay. Flight left on time. 737-400 Combi's don't have inflight Wi-Fi but all the 737-800s do for a charge of $4.95 for a single flight pass. Overall Alaska Airlines is a great airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,J Velez,6th August 2013,Departed on time from DCA bound for SEA on a 737-400 window seat 16 impossible to move in or out while other two passengers occupied their respective seats. The individual on the middle seat wore the most puzzling attitude making it absolutely awful to even attempt to exit for a loo break for the 4 plus hour trip. Blame the ludicrous spacing that makes it an absolute necessity to require other passengers to co0operate multiple times during a long flight. From SEA to JUN still a fully loaded aircraft yet uneventful and more pleasant neighbor passengers. JUN to final destination PSG a short hour long hop. A short 30 min delay at SEA. Return PSG by way of WRG then KTN imposed an hour an a half delay due not to weather. We arrived late night at SEA and then off to catch a ride to a local awful Seatac Inn for an overnight layover. Flight back to DCA was more pleasant. FA mobilized quickly to keep the full cabin stocked with minute free snacks beverages in cups and purchased meals. Entertainment was avail at 10 dollars for a shared small screen pad which battery quickly ran out of charge. The DCA to SEA is a long flight on a regularly cramped cabin. The spacing between seats is insufficient for a 155 lb. 6 ft. man to exit the window seat without interfering or annoying uncooperative passengers. It is difficult to hold biological needs for such long travel distances.,,,Economy Class,,,1,5,4,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,8,S Tepelekian,17th July 2013,LAX-ANC-LAX. Seats were very comfortable and the staff service was great. They even gave us free peanuts and cookies! Although all of these were good the in-flight entertainment is horrible. It is basically an IPad that you rent at $12. Not worth it. Overall this was a great airline. I would definitely fly Alaska Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,S Alama,15th July 2013,I flew First Class from Palm Springs to San Francisco on July 7th. I have flown First Class on this route many times in the past with Alaska. In the past they had a great choice of salad or cheese plate on the flight with great service. Now they have totally eliminated that and didn't even bother to ask if anyone wanted a refill on their drink which they served with a cheap bag of pretzels. The flight attendant did everything possible not to walk in First Class but stayed in the galley doing nothing. Standards have gone down on Alaska.,,,First Class,,,3,1,1,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,7,Keith Rands-Allen,9th July 2013,Flew from San Jose to Fairbanks via Seattle. A good trip. Flight was on time. We knew no food was served so took our own. AA guarantee that if you don't receive your bags within 20 minutes of the plane arriving at the gate they will pay compensation ($20 I think). Our bags arrived within this time limit.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,M Haywood,8th July 2013,We flew from Seattle to Las Vegas with a connection in Portland as a direct flight would have meant hanging around too long. As we live in UK we were nervous that flights would be delayed given some negative reviews here. Everything went smoothly and right on time. We were impressed with complimentary drinks service given that similar budget airlines in the UK all charge for drinks. Our return flight direct to Seattle was again on time . We found baggage check in quick and friendly and with the exception of one rather curt stewardess everyone else was absolutely fine.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Nico Gray,7th July 2013,PHX-SEA-PHX. Service was great. They were on time. Boeing 737-800 both ways. I would recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,4,Andre Franca,1st July 2013,SEA-ANC-ORD I consider my two experiences with this airline poor ones! The staff are friendly but flights are often delayed! On board crew seem lost this made me feel very uncomfortable these days you pay for everything extra when you fly them even for the bags. Won't be flying Alaska again unless the price is right.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Susan James,30th June 2013,On time and even had two inflight beverage services from Los Angeles to Seattle. This was economy. On the way back to Los Angeles I flew First Class. Was nice to have a meal.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,Lee Bruno,26th June 2013,I am retired and am fortunate enough to fly first class extensively and often on a variety of airlines both in the US and Europe. I recently flew first class with my wife round trip from Las Vegas to Anchorage and plan to never fly Alaska again. Every employee I had contact with was pleasant and courteous the planes were on time but the only benefit in flying first was the additional legroom. The outbound and inbound flights were 2 weeks apart but breakfast both mornings was the same and only thing what they called eggs benedict with turkey ham which was on a piece of dry bread and was tasteless. Lunch was also one choice a chicken salad on a tiny salad plate with out bread cracker or chip desert was one piece of rolled candy. There was no TV on the leg of the flight to Seattle to Anchorage they provided a small hand held screen with a choice of 4-5 movies and short clips. I have never had such cheap and thoughtless meals on any of my previous flights. I would never recommend this Airline but if your required to fly it don't waste your money on first class.,,,First Class,,,3,4,1,1,,2,no

Alaska Airlines,9,Streb Lovell,16th June 2013,SEA-MFR via PDX then PDX-SEA. All flights on time. Service great. No complaints except maybe the skimpy selection of beverages but these are such short flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,W Coenik,13th June 2013,Flew from Honolulu to Newark return in First. Flew Alaska last year in first and was so impressed booked with them again. Great service and the meals are just some of the best I have had on a plane. Flights were on time except for a delay because of weather but that's flying for you. Cant blame the airline for that. The staff are helpful and polite. Love the small first class of only 16 seats. Makes it feel like being on a small business jet as very individual service. Again well done to Alaska and would fly with them again.,,,First Class,,,4,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,T Jedlicka,2nd June 2013,We have been trying for two days to get to Fairbanks and have spent 15 hours in airports and not there yet. There has been delay after delay and none of them weather related. The delays and cancellations have all been maintenance and crew problems which seem to be a systemic problem with Alaska Airlines starting with their top management. This is Sunday and I tried to talk to a supervisor in the Anchorage Airport and was told that supervisors aren't available on Sunday.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,R Hesser,2nd June 2013,"SJC-OGG SJC-LIH SAN-BOS return in F on relatively new 737-800 aircraft. While Alaska planes may not have the ""bells and whistles"" of JetBlue or Virgin America Alaska succeeds by running a very reliable operation offering a decent inflight product and friendly service. From Bay Area to Hawaii I was able to upgrade to First via online check-in for $100. Worth every penny! Check-in was fast and no charge for 2 bags. On board pre-flight beverages offered and menus were distributed. Mid-range wine choices but glasses were kept refilled throughout. The Alaskan Amber beer is quite good too. Breakfast served in 2 courses and Lunch/Dinner in 3 courses and the pace of service was quite relaxed. A snack later in the flight. Food and portions were very good on all flights. Crew were very polite and addressed passengers by last name. One FA even personally thanked each passenger for their business at the end. IFE consisted of a ""digeplayer"" providing a wide choice. The touchscreen worked well and the picture was clear although the sound quality will be much better if you bring your own headphones. F seats are basic domestic F but the extra width and legroom certainly make the upgrade worthwhile. Best part is their excellent on-time performance. I've only encountered 2 delays in the past 30+ flights.",,,First Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Gordon McFarlane,27th May 2013,Victoria - Seattle - Maui return in First Class. The service was impeccable and breakfast on the outbound flight was very good and spread out over a couple of hours which helped pass the time. Lunch on the inbound flight was equally good with a choice of sirloin steak or sweet and sour chicken. Frequent offers of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages throughout the flights. Individual entertainment tablets with a wide range of films and TV shows. Attendants were very friendly and attentive. All the flights departed on time and arrived on time. This is the first time travelling on Alaska First Class and it was well worth the additional cost. My only disappointment was The Boardroom at Sea-Tac. It was pretty drab with a poor choice of food/snacks (both in the morning and early evening). It is certainly not worth $45 a visit. It is not a patch on Air Canada's Maple Leaf lounges.,,,First Class,,,4,5,5,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,Natasha Powell,26th May 2013,LAX to DCA on May 23rd. Apart from one every other flight attendant was rude and scowled the whole trip. No greeting as we boarded the plane no follow through with promises to help provide first aid (or a simple bandaid after an injury) and no explanation for delays that occurred. The attendants seemed annoyed when customers asked for beverages when we were seemingly skipped. Overall this flight is miserable and the staff are far less pleasant than the attendants who work for foreign or even domestic airlines that I have flown with recently. Granted the lack of amenities on this older flight doesn't add much to the comfort of fl going across country but a pleasant attitude for the staff wouldn't hurt.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,1,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,,Nicole Sherman,10th May 2013,My flight from Honolulu to San Jose was delayed 2.5 hours today which made me miss my connecting flight to Atlanta. They then told me there were no flight tonight to the east coast yet while I was sitting with an employee waiting for new boarding passes for tomorrow a flight to New York was boarding right next to me. Not a full flight either! They changed my flight but then brought me outside to wait for a shuttle to a hotel. I was left on the curb with 5 suitcases and a duffel bag and waited an hour. I finally called the hotel and they told me the shuttle had stopped running at midnight. I ended up having to take a taxi to the hotel. The next day when I was boarding my new flight I had to pay to check my bags again. All in all I paid 60$ extra for re checking my bags a 15 dollar cab and absolutely no sleep. They had absolutely horrible customer service and late flights.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Steven Montgomery,25th April 2013,After a very unsatisfying flight on Delta from ATL to SEA it was a privilege to board our Alaska Airlines flight to ANC. Not only the extra legroom and comfort of the aircraft but the excellent cabin crew made me forget the horrible service Delta had just delivered.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,A Whittle,23rd April 2013,"Round trip SAN/PVR April 4-12. Alaska's first is more of a ""light first"". Seats and legroom just so so. Same pasta dish on both legs served along side a small salad. No roll butter or dessert. Flight attendants on both legs were great they seemed embarrassed about the meal quality but kept drinks flowing and were very pleasant. Both flights on time. Travelled on BA award tickets.",,,First Class,,,3,5,2,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Stephen G Sweet,22nd April 2013,ANC to RNO with stop in SEA. I must admit that I was pleased with Alaska and Horizon Air in both directions. I flew their 737/8 on the way down and the 900 model on return. Planes were clean service was much better than I have had in the past. If they keep it up I may end up with them again soon. Good job and a decent price for what I received.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Nathan Green,21st April 2013,I flew from SEA to PHX the flight was great the ground staff and inflight staff very accommodating. They give out free snacks and a choice to purchase a inflight meal/snack. I will be flying Alaska Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,M Dayan,16th April 2013,We travelled overnight from Seattle to Orlando and were seated in the very back row of the plane. These seats are hard up against the back wall of the plane and do not recline. It was a most uncomfortable trip I can remember and would definitely recommend avoiding travelling with Alaskan Air.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,5,Ellen Johnson,2nd April 2013,I flew to Las Vegas March 29th and returned April 1. First class round-trip $777. Service down was slow and we were served a cheese platter. Not a significant midday meal but it was sufficient. Returning was worse. Nearly an hour before cocktails were delivered. We were not served the cheese platter. We were served hot pasta in cheese sauce on a sad looking salad bed. I asked the Flight Attendant for the cheese platter instead as I heard them offering it to the coach passengers. She advised that I would have to pay for it. She was rude and smug. Apparently I can drink you dry of scotch but have to pay additional for a decent meal. In addition after being served our drinks another Flight Attendant came up to us and asked if we wanted our pretzel bags as they did not have enough to serve coach. I have been flying Alaska Airlines since 1973. This is the worst service I have received coach or first class. Flying 1st class is more than a wider seat. It represents a gracious and superior attention to the passengers for which a premium is being paid.,,,First Class,,,4,1,2,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,M Wharfe,1st April 2013,Shuttle flight from Seattle to Portland and we missed the original connection as our international flight was late. AS couldn't have done more to help us and got us on the standby list on loaded and even sat together. Quick flight friendly crew and always my first choice for us domestic flights.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Scott Bourne,26th March 2013,Flew from Anchorage to Seattle with a seat on a plane from Seattle to Vegas. The weather was bad in Anchorage but the pilot assured us we'd make our connections. Got to the gate in Vegas 21 minutes before the flight was set to leave. The Las Vegas crew was alerted that 45 of us from the Anchorage plane were bound for Vegas. The gate agent would not let us on the plane. Smiled smugly and said sorry. We all went to the customer service centre where a man told us we were lucky to get seats on the 9.35 flight. While I was at customer service I noticed the Vegas plane was still at the gate - 20 minutes later. I paid almost $1800 for this experience. Clearly Alaska Airlines isn't interested in customer service.,,,First Class,,,3,1,3,4,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,S Symon,26th March 2013,DCA-LAX on a 737-800. Plane pushed back from the gate 15 minutes before scheduled departure time and was in the air right on time (I can't remember the last time this has happened). Aircraft was very clean and the leather seats were very comfortable. The crew did 3 drink runs and we received plenty of updates from the flight deck which I always appreciate. Will definitely consider flying them again since they have a codeshare agreement with American Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,G Johnson,22nd March 2013,Seattle to Maui return. Planes departed on time and arrived slightly early both ways. Baggage was already waiting for us when we arrived in claim area. Attendants were very courteous and pleasant. Food purchased was just fine-deli pack. I usually travel Alaska if possible and have not had anything to complain about. They have always departed on time and done a good job!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Ned Hopkins,22nd March 2013,"SFO-SJD return. The flight to Los Cabos left and arrived on time the return flight left half an hour early but was required to circle SFO for almost as long before landing. Snacks on the 2hr 40min flights were edible nothing more. FAs were attentive. Seats were comfortable but legroom was as tight as any I've experienced in a first class (or business class) cabin. Alaska now departs from the new SJD terminal it lacks some of the features - dining options in particular - that made the ""old"" one a pleasant place to await boarding.",,,First Class,,,4,5,3,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,S Koenig,15th March 2013,First class KOA-PDX. Flight was on time. Seats fine. Food fine. In-flight entertainment (individual hand- held devices) fine. Nothing spectacular but we had no complaints. We chose Alaska over Hawaiian because it was fully refundable in first class and also non-stop from Kona to Portland where as Hawaiian was not unless you purchased a much more expensive ticket.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,M Silva Green,13th March 2013,Staff indifferent and rude. We had a 4 hour delay from Kona to Portland and they offered no inflight freebies to compensate. Going to Maui they kept serving alcohol to passengers that were drunk.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,2,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,Barbara A Hestdalen,7th March 2013,Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service. We have been to Hawaii 20+ times on other airlines and never had such an uncomfortable flight as on Alaska.,,,First Class,,,1,4,3,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,6,Lizabeth Southworth,21st February 2013,I recently flew round-trip from Boston to Seattle on Alaska Airlines. I was happy that we: 1) arrived safely 2) arrived on-time. I didn't check a bag so cannot rate their handling of my luggage. I was surprised to learn that even on longer haul flights in-flight entertainment was not complimentary as it is on other airlines. In addition the food offerings had no hot meal suitable for a vegetarian at any meal. My seat on the flight to SEA was very uncomfortable but adequate on the return flight. Alaska Airlines got the major points right but there's plenty of room for improvement!,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,2,1,,,no
Alaska Airlines,3,J Cranford,20th February 2013,LAX-SJD-LAX Feb 15 First Class. What a disappointing experience. We purchased (not upgraded or miles) first class tickets to Cabo expecting a lot more. The first class seat pitch was awful in rows 2 and 3. Very cramped! Forget it if the person in front of you leans back at all. It also appears that the 3rd (and last row of 1st) has minimal seat recline. The condition of the seats : The leather was very distressed marked up and very worn. When we boarded at Cabo for the return flight to LAX there were crumbs all over the seats and floor. The food (both ways): a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate. Not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays. I'd say this product is an embarrassment to this airline.,,,First Class,,,2,3,2,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Tess Smith,19th February 2013,Flight was late on both legs of round trip. The food advertised was not available and what was available they ran out of so we could not feed our 3 yrs old. When my husband complained the flight attendant happened to find something. There should be enough food for the passengers especially when you're landing at 10.30pm.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,1,3,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,C Adams,16th January 2013,The day we were to depart was a bad weather day for the North Eastern part of the country and the aircraft we were to take from Reagan International was delayed due to weather. When we arrived at the airport shortly before the flight I received a call regarding this delay. When we finally go to the ticket counter the agent informed us that we would more than likely miss our connecting flight and they wanted us to depart from Dulles. After speaking to the customer service agent we were informed of the situation and they would pay for a taxi to get to Dulles send our bags and upgrade us on the United flight to first class. We got to Dulles with time to spare boarded our flight and got to California early enough to get a good nights rest before catching our connection. End result we arrived to our destination refreshed on time and ready. Our luggage arrived with us as well.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,G Cueto,10th January 2013,DCA-SEA Dec 24 Y class. Orderly bordering and flight left on time (it helped that DCA was practically empty at 5pm on Christmas eve). Seats clean and definitely provided more legroom than my United flight a few weeks later. Service efficient but nothing extraordinary. Solid and consistent performance.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,3,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Suzanne Allemeier,8th January 2013,Just flew from Vancouver to San Diego via LAX with Alaska. 2nd segment was with a Delta Regional operating for Alaska. My bag which was checked through did not arrive. Airport rep said it was the 3rd day in a row this had happened on the Vancouver flight. When I called Alaska to find out why this known problem was not addressed and why I was the third day victim the rep kept trying to tell me it was Delta's fault and then hung up on me.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,8,A Craig,8th January 2013,BLI to HNL on 26 December 2012. Alaska's in-flight staff were excellent on this flight. Three beverage services and free mai tai's before landing. The rented Digiplayer was delivered promptly after take-off. Staff were all very cheerful and did their best to make our flight enjoyable. Excellent work.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,R Crawford,3rd January 2013,Excellent flight on new 739-900ER yesterday (AS 109) from SEA to ANC. Excellent crew and great service all in light on a very bumpy flight due to strong winds along the route. Last few flights on AS have really been good with on time departures and arrivals.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Jannie Every,21st December 2012,I have been sitting in Calgary airport for 4 hours with little communication from the staff as to what is going on. First they have us board the plane and the plane is not even functioning. Then they have us sit on the plane for over an hour before telling us what is going on. Then finally they instruct everyone to get off the plane and wait. And wait. And still waiting. Finally an hour later they board us again saying everything is repaired and we are ready to go. Oh but wait we are still sitting here waiting with no communication from the flight team. I will never fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,A Chun,20th December 2012,I flew from DFW to Seattle then on to Honolulu. Interior of the planes are shabby and worn. Seats are hard and narrow with minimum recline. No pillows blankets or footrests. FA tossed a bag of mixed nuts toward my hubby by the window seat couldn't she have handed it to him?,,,First Class,,,2,2,3,2,,,no
Alaska Airlines,2,Alex Hill,17th December 2012,I started flying another airline about 2 years ago but today decided to give Alaska another chance. I was sorely disappointed. The ticketing agents greeted me with frowns and a cold mechanical demeanour. The woman managing the line was condescending and seemed irritated with everyone. When I boarded I found my seat 3-A to not fully recline. The amount of leg room wasn't enough to cross my leg at the ankle and the general appearance was worn out and dirty. Once we were in the air the man in front of me reclined and I was no longer able to reach my bag under the seat. Now I would expect this in a coach seat but again they're calling this first class. I was served a lacklustre although well presented breakfast of eggs with tomato and asparagus a potato cake and fresh (ish) fruit. The flight attendant in my cabin was prompt and polite but the announcement about Alaska air credit cards droned on for what seemed like an eternity. Alaska built a reputation with exceptional customer service and a clean well maintained fleet of aircraft. Today booth there workforce and equipment seems to be in need of a serious overhaul.,,,First Class,,,1,3,3,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,7,W Smith,5th December 2012,I fly Alaska a lot - MVP Gold for several consecutive years. I maintain this status mainly through partner airline miles. The main reason I stick with Alaska is that they have direct flights to two of my primary destinations from SEA where other airlines have stops in between. Service on Alaska is wildly variable. One flight will be the best service I can remember and the very next flight will be painful and unpleasant. So - if you are lucky and get a newer aircraft and a good crew you are good to go. If on the other hand you get one of the worn-out planes and/or a crew that couldn't care less if you were there or not.,,,First Class,,,3,3,4,3,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,C Logiacco,26th November 2012,Flew from SFO to Seattle Seattle to LA and then Seattle to SFO. Check in and boarding was seamless - for each flight we departed either on time or ahead of the scheduled departure time and luggage was always ready to be picked up within 20 mins of exiting the aircraft. Flight crew are friendly. Will fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Varsha Agarwal,30th October 2012,SFO to Seattle. Printed my boarding pass and was waiting to board my late night flight back to Seattle which was delayed by 3 hours. When I checked my options for changing the flight I was told its a non refundable ticket and to change was $100. Staff do not appear trained to be polite and offer service. We waited for passengers from a connecting flight to arrive this consumed another 30 minutes.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,10,D Winkowski,8th October 2012,I choose Alaska over United on my flights from LAX to PDX or SEA because they fly 737 and not commuters and offer a better Coach product than United. Crew seems happy to be there and they have hot food to purchase with good coffee! Having Wifi is a plus as well.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,H McTyre,30th September 2012,SEA-ANC return in First. On the way up Anchorage was expecting bad weather. The FAs who had already delayed providing any first class service until about 50 minutes into the flight decided more than an hour out of ANC to prepare the cabin for landing. They got on the overhead and informed everyone that the captain had ordered this then promptly ceased service closed the restrooms and plopped down in their jump seats to chat. (This was clearly visible from First.) About a half hour of smooth flying later the pilot got on the intercom and announced that the FAs should begin preparing the cabin for arrival. It was obvious he had no idea the FAs had ceased working 30 minutes earlier. Alaska really needs to do something about its FAs. They used to be the best in the business such that it was a real treat to get to fly Alaska on this leg; now this route in particular is staffed by burnouts. I get better treatment on Delta for my Alaska frequent flyer status than I do on Alaska.,,,First Class,,,3,1,1,2,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,4,R Kornacki,28th September 2012,Traveled to and from Anchorage from Kansas City in Sep 2012. Amazing to find the Alaska Airlines structures built in several airports to squeeze hold baggage fees from customers - but poorly staffed. Lines were longer when standing in line to check bags where baggage fees had been earlier paid on the web by credit card. On the full flight back from Anchorage to Seattle on 17 September I don't know that I have ever been packed tighter in an aircraft. I am not a tall man and my knees were in contact with the seat in front of me for that uncomfortable 3 hour leg. I know the economy is tough and the airline business intent upon wringing the last buck they can from the consumer but Alaska Airlines has taken this to a new level. I felt for the flight attendants hawking meals video devices and other such up and down the aisle. In Seattle prior to the last leg to Kansas City they gave us a start by posting a 7 hour delay- with no explanation whatever. Fortunately after 20 minutes of angst the original departure time was reinstated. I last traveled to Alaska on Alaska Airlines quite a few years ago and the present experience in coach was like night and day.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,W Coenik,26th September 2012,Flew Newark to Honolulu via Seattle and Bellingham First Class. First time with Alaska. Very impressive. Seats comfortable food was great. The flight from Bellingham to Honolulu had the best airline food I have had. The crew were friendly on all legs. One thing that did annoy was that even though an announcement was made at the start of each flight that the front toilet was for first class only during the flight Economy passengers would use it and not be stopped. The digeplayer was not up to the standard of in seat units and did not have a good selection. But overall excellent flights. Would fly with them again.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,D Mauro,18th September 2012,Alaska Airlines is slightly better than other major U.S. carriers. Like the legacy carriers they have also done away with blankets entertainment and free coach food. Fortunately flight attendants were actually kind and I did find the seats to be noticeably more comfortable. Having a friendly smiling crew and a nice seat made quite a difference.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,2,2,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,D Harper,17th September 2012,"Heading to Disneyland for our daughter's sixth birthday. Planned well in advance and when it comes to checking in they have separated the three of us with their updated seat assignment. We all have the same last name an it clearly states that we're travelling with a child. Get to the gate only to be told by the agent that she can't do anything and we should ask the flight attendants to find us seats together. We get in the plane and explain the situation to the flight attendants and they now tell us that hey can't do anything and we're out of luck. ""Maybe someone will be nice enough to switch seats with you"". Is this really how you handle mistakes? By passing the buck and doing nothing? A complete disappointment from a company that has obviously forgotten what customer service means.",,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,David Passmore,3rd September 2012,I booked a one way trip from Seattle to Los Angeles and after reading some of the negative comments I was a little concerned. It turned out my worries were unfounded. I booked my trip online some time before the trip and got a very reasonable price. I was able to select seats on reservation and was able to change them when checking in online. On arrival at Seatac check in was smooth and swift and the boarding process was well organised. Staff on board were pleasant and informative and I found the on board wi-fi excellent - and cheaper than what some hotels charge! All in all a very pleasant flight and would certainly use Alaska again without any hesitation.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Shelley Bogaert,30th August 2012,One way from San Diego to Seattle in first class. I paid approximately $450 for the seat. The extent of the food service on the 2.5 hour flight was a fruit and cheese plate. Pitiful to describe and worse to eat. There was also absolutely no in-flight entertainment no headsets and no video.,,,First Class,,,3,4,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,J Levy,29th August 2012,We were very disappointed during our 4 weeks trip around Alaska and way to Hawaii with Alaska Airlines. We used it for many flights. SEA-JUN JUN-CVA CVA-ANC Fairbanks-Barrow Anchorage-HNL and HNL-SEA and always the same opinion. Old dated planes service near zero (no free meals) just peanuts and drinks. You have to pay for your luggage when you don't travel only around Alaska: for us a total of 80 USD. More over no entertainment you have to pay 10$ to watch old movies. To conclude crew not very friendly.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Baining Guo,7th August 2012,I already checked into my flight and got my boarding pass at the airport. However with Alaska you have to wait in line to pay for your luggage separately (is this something new?). By the time it was my turn to pay for my luggage they said my luggage was too late for the flight. The luggage needs to be paid and checked in 40 min before the flight. As a result they took my boarding pass away and switch me to a flight 8 hrs later. Because of the huge delay my business activities all have to be sacrificed.,,,First Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Joseph Stewart,7th August 2012,I showed up 2 hours early but a TSA-Alaska problem made me miss my flight. Their small print symbol calling for additional security screening was missed by TSA so when I went to board they had to send me back to TSA and I missed my flight. The worst part is that they wouldn't put me on the next flight to my destination (on another airline) and made me wait 5+ hours for another Alaska flight. I would have been better off driving. I'll avoid flying with Alaska air in the future if I can.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Anne Taplin,16th July 2012,My husband and I were refused to fly because he had an airline approved oxygenator to take on as hand luggage and it would not be used in flight. We had purchased First class tickets to from Seattle to Hawaii they put us on another Airline those seats were economy and the cost of those tickets were $360.00 pp and we had paid over $700 pp - they gave us a refund of $105 pp.,,,First Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,Brian Parker,9th July 2012,LAX-PDX-BLI and BLI-SEA-SFO. All flights were completely full. Comfort on all aircraft's was surprisingly good. What lets them down is the staff. Robotic flight attendants going through the motions. Check-in staff in Bellingham were agonizingly slow. There were only two customers in front of me. 20 mins later there were still two customers in front of me. When I finally reached the counter my bag was 50.7 pounds. I am told to re-pack it. I took one shoe out of my suitcase and put it in my carry-on and she accepted my suitcase. On both Horizon Air flights (PDX-BLI-SEA) flight attendants sat in their jumpseats and read magazines the entire flight. My Alaska Seattle-San Francisco flight ended up arriving over an hour late. I had to run through SFO to catch my Air New Zealand flight. What a pleasure to be greeted at the door of Air NZ by smiling polite cabin crew.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,2,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,4,L Melbourne,8th July 2012,Found planes to be aged and shabby. Tray tables dirty would not want to eat off them. Staff seemed friendly but their uniforms were unimpressive. Had a delay out of Seattle and everyone was made to get off plane travel by train to another terminal to board another plane because of a broken seat. This was obviously known about before we boarded so they should not have put that plane back into service before it was fixed. Would not recommend this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,2,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,2,K Lutz,5th July 2012,Previously I have had mostly positive experiences with Alaska Airlines. However over an hour after boarding the plane we are still sitting at the gate waiting for maintenance and my 16 month old is getting fussy. I ask the FA if she can get us some juice to calm him down and am told no even though she is serving coffee to other passengers. 30 minutes later we are still sitting there and he is seeing everyone else getting drinks but him and starts to cry at which point the FA comes back and tells me to make him be quiet. I fly with my son almost twice a month and have never had a problem. On any other airline they would have tried to help the situation by talking to him or bringing a snack or a pair of wings. But not this one.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,3,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Dan Franklin,5th July 2012,Being based in Portland I am stuck traveling Alaska 75% of the time for business travel and was never impressed with the quality of the planes or service. Recently I used rewards miles for a trip to Honolulu. The plane was a standard 737 with absolutely no amenities. The overhead air barely blew. Service was terrible. Based on the most recent experience with their customer service I will try even harder to not fly Alaska and I am cancelling their rewards credit card. The other 25% I travel United and have never had a problem with their planes or service.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,5,Jade West,2nd July 2012,I flew in from round trips OAK to HNL both flights were awful. The money I paid for these two flight's were great and that's the main reason I'm not too hateful towards them. The food was not bad. The staff service was good. The main reason my experience with Alaska Airlines was awful is because the actual aircraft's I flew in were horrible! The seats were incredibly small I was feeling very cramped during the whole flight's it was impossible to sleep on those plane's because the recliner's barely reclined. The leg room was ridiculous it's really hard to get up and go to the lavatory. The lavatory is also a bit small. There was not any complimentary in-flight entertainment expect the crew members offered screens to watch movies shows etc with a 10$ fee. Overall Alaska Airlines is mediocre. If you want a good price to go to Hawaii but understand that you will suffer cramped seats for 5 and half hours fly Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,4,3,,5,no
Alaska Airlines,1,D Livak,1st July 2012,Flew SFO to SEA. My 9.20am flight was over sold. I was bumped to another flight leaving from OAK 5 hours later. My return flight left 5 hours late after changing planes twice because of mechanical problems. Worst flight experience I have had on many years and I fly 50000 plus miles a year. I haven't flown Alaska in 20 years and I never will again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Olivia Lane,12th June 2012,I would not recommend Frontier for those with connections. My flight from BNA-SFO with a connection in Denver was grounded because of plane problems. We were grounded in St Louis and agents were most unhelpful. I was stuck in St Louis and only got to my destination because I booked other flights in order to do so. Frontier does not do anything but give a 200 voucher for a missed connection. On my way back from SFO to BNA (connecting through Denver) we were grounded for a medical emergency which is understandable however no help given to those who missed connections. I got home on my own doing by booking a Southwest flight while we were grounded in Grand Junction. They have limiting options to help you out if you miss a connection.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,4,4,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,9,D Smith,11th June 2012,MCI-SEA-ANC- May 2012. All flights on time no delays. Had an excellent Tuscan pasta dish. Return was also without hitch long layover in SEA but got passes to the Boardroom and enjoyed to space and quiet. All of our flights on Alaska have been positive and enjoyable.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,Steven Gilbert,5th June 2012,I was flying from DCA to SAN with a connection in Denver. DCA to DEN was a nice enough flight with no complaints. However when my flight from DEN to SAN came they were unable to get a pilot. Keep in mind that DEN is Frontier's hub. This occurred at 10.10 pm and by the time I was able to speak with customer service the earliest flight that I could get to SAN was 9 pm the next day. Fortunately I did not have plans the next day but I know several people in the line who had to miss out on their plans due to this.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,8,Nikolas Lazar,4th June 2012,Overall my flight was very pleasant. The crew were nice and friendly and for the most part the plane was clean. They forgot the digeplayers however and the wifi was iffy so definitely bring a ipad along with you with non-wifi apps. The headrests are annoying for shorter passenger as they are literally a pain in the neck. Overall Alaska Airlines was a cheap alternative to other airlines to Seattle.,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,K Danenhauer,31st May 2012,"I bought tickets to fly myself and my 2 young kids (ages 4 and 2) from Salt Lake to Kansas City 2 months in advance. Inexplicably Frontier did not assign us seats together. For each of the 4 legs on this round-trip gate agents did a little shuffling to get us in the same row. But I still had to personally ask other people already on their seats to move. Travelling alone this wouldn't have been a big deal but with two little kids? Just getting on the plane and taking care of everyone's food potty and entertainment needs is stressful enough. Frontier made this such an unpleasant experience that I will avoid getting any tickets on Frontier again. When I said something about this to a flight attendant I got the response ""Well that's Frontier for you!""",,,Economy Class,,,1,2,2,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,5,R Dunham,21st May 2012,LAX-SEA-LAX-GDL in First Class. Alaska served the same meal consisting of a Chicken Sandwich and orzo pasta salad on all sectors. I was especially disappointed on the International sector of LAX-GDL. Alaska Airlines was on time for all sectors baggage was delivered promptly and the inflight cabin staff were efficient. They have to learn to vary their menu for First Class Passengers especially on International Sectors. Thus the mediocre rating.,,,First Class,,,3,4,2,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,G Zett,9th May 2012,PDX-LGB return. While the flight was technically on SkyWest it is abundantly clear that this is an Alaska Air operation from the plane livery to the standard level of service given - which is to say a cut above. Clean CRJ planes 2x beverage service - no charge for microbrew beer or Pacific Northwest wines arrived on time with not much fuss. Only quibbles were the standard narrow CRJ seating and any food other than a package of pretzels had to be purchased. I liked the fact that the counter person suggested I check my bag plane- side avoiding the ridiculous $20 surcharge on all counter-checked luggage.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Mike Archambault,3rd May 2012,OGG-SEA-BOS First Class. Flying in first class and not having to worry about paying $18 for the video player plus 2 suitcases each was almost worth it. We boarded on time and were given a plastic cup of water. The flight attendant took our coats and was polite and attentive. He let us know our food choices and was very attentive throughout the flight. We arrived early into SEA and had a 3 hour layover we went to the first class lounge in another terminal but had time to kill. Free food relaxing and comfortable lounge was appreciated. We boarded on time for BOS and again were given great service and lots of attention. I was pleased with my time in first class and just booked again for our return next Feb.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,C Cleven,24th April 2012,ATL-SEA in First Class. Lamb dinner was very good. Service excellent. New version of Digiplayer entertainment system is a big improvement. Left on time arrived a little early. Seat comfortable. Couldn't ask for much more.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Geronimo Saagun,24th April 2012,I am a 75K elite status on this Airline and fly every weekend and also 1 million miler status since two years ago but sadly have seen a dramatic decline in service. First class not worth the cost. Upgrades even with my status are rare. Food is horrible. I recommend you stick with either American or Delta or United or Southwest for elite status. MVP Gold and 75K means nothing to the airline.,,,First Class,,,3,3,1,4,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,2,C Odonnell,24th April 2012,I have been an Alaska Airlines MVP Gold passenger for 6 years. Each year the service and attitude slips in the past 2 years more than ever in crew attitude food portions and quality. The routes I fly for business are SEA-ANC SEA-DCA and SEA-LAZ. Last two round trips one to DCA and to LAX were especially bad. The plane had not been well serviced the food was not up to standard and FA's did not care about the over heated cabin. The sorry truth is that on the SEA-ANC and SEA-WDC flights Alaska knows that they can be poor and still outshine their competitors.,,,First Class,,,2,,2,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,3,D Allen,11th April 2012,We flew from Bellingham to Honolulu HI and back with Alaska Airlines. On the flight to HI we sat in row 23. By the time the food service got to us (I was willing to pay for food) they were out of the good food and only had things that no one else wanted to buy. Lousy service lousy prices. Late leaving HI for Bellingham by 30 minutes. This airline continues to go down hill. Years ago it was a great airline. Not so much anymore.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,6,R Crawford,15th March 2012,Cost-cutting measures are showing more and more. Although first class is quite expensive it really isn't worth the extra expense anymore except for the larger seats and increased legroom. Meal service is a shadow of what it used to be just a few years ago. A recent flight from Anchorage to Seattle features a chicken curry salad that was frightful while the nice desserts have shrunk to a small piece of candy. Not impressed.,,,First Class,,,3,3,3,4,,2,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Jason Macnair,12th March 2012,Terrible Airline cheap with bad service. My plane landed in Seattle for a connecting flight at 10.40pm my connecting flight left at 11.00pm. Though the flight staff announced that all those people who needed to get on connecting flights be let off the plane first none of the passengers complied when we landed. Flight staff did nothing to ensure that folks who needed to get connecting flights got to them on time. I ended up at my gate at 10.55pm though flight staff closed the gate anyway no apology no help.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,3,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,T Sauve,29th February 2012,We flew to Mexico in coach. Both ways they ran out of food and we were at the front of the plane row 8. Trying to get one of the attendants to serve you for a drink is a nightmare. We have flown many times and each time it goes down hill further. Our next flight is in First Class so lets see if it is any better. After reading the reviews I am not holding my breath.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,K Hazelip,23rd February 2012,First Class is an expensive joke. An ageing fleet makes for poor seats and amenities. Food is poor - both legs of our first class trip brought the reality that only some in first class are allowed to order from the menu. For both legs we were given food that was unwanted and in fact inedible.,,,First Class,,,3,2,1,3,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,4,A Singh,9th January 2012,YEG-SEA-LAX both flights were considerably disappointing. Food - all I had was a small snack. Drinks were good. Flight Attendants were hit and miss in responding to requests. There was no inflight entertainment. Seats weren't very comfortable with little to no space.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,2,1,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,3,S Oesterblad,26th October 2011,I filled out everything from seat number to meal preference it turned out to be a waste of time. There is no food other than pricey snacks and the seats assigned at check-in. I was taken back by the lack of free onboard movies instead you have to purchase that too. As well as being turned away from using lavatory in front of airplane - that's reserved for higher paying customers. So not having been on Alaska in sometime I was very disappointed.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,2,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,8,P Sorli,24th October 2011,YVR-LAX-YVR. Both flights relatively full and on-time. Great service FAs and surprisingly comfortable seats (though narrow). The only negative thing to point out is their terminal in LAX which is not good at all - overcrowded and dirty.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,H McTyre,21st October 2011,ANC-SFO-PSP-ANC First Class. Flight attendants do not serve first class like first class. It's more like you're time warped back into what Coach used to be like. Drinks on offer before takeoff - tepid water poured out of an open common bottle into a plastic cup. Service after takeoff indifferent. Food not great. Interestingly if you request an alcoholic drink they bring you two mini-bottles of the alcohol but don't bring you the can of tonic/soda/whatever that goes with it so you can mix it yourself. Planes are exceedingly loud with announcements from FAs but if the pilot speaks you can't hear a word. Between that and the thin rocky seats make sure you pack your ibuprofen.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Renee Skafte,21st October 2011,My family and I were scheduled to traveled from DC to Seattle this week but we accidentally went to the wrong airport. Our mistake completely however you would have never guessed that considering the way the ground crew treated us. They immediately got us rescheduled on another flight to LA and on again to Seattle. They made sure we had our seats together as much as possible and were as hospitable as could possibly be. I've always felt that our prior experiences on Alaska Air were always good but I was truly impressed with their service on this last trip. I am certain that we would not have had such luck on any other airline. I want to thank Alaska Air for making a possible bad situation a positive and comfortable day for us.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,B Thomas,20th October 2011,I've had to fly Alaska almost every Monday morning and Thursday evening for the past 2.5 months from Seattle to Oakland because of a project I was on. Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours; that's absurd) and their MVP Gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers (they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied). Overall I have enjoyed them however and I will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a Seattle-to-Houston trip (there are no nonstop flights going to Houston on Sunday afternoons with Alaska or its partner airlines so I'll have to get there using Continental and come back on Alaska which is fine).,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,Helen Canny,14th October 2011,I flew 6 hrs from Seattle to Kona on a full flight. The only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane. Being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets. It was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight. We were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through. An other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements. Please let us have some peace and quiet! We noticed the contrast with Hawaiian Airlines which was so tranquil and relaxing with no loud publicity of special deals and unnecessary announcements of impending drinks trolley.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,9,S Kendall,10th October 2011,SEA-MIA. I had the misfortune of missing my flight the night before (my fault). I ended up flying out the next morning on my birthday my travel partner mentioned to the FAs that it was my birthday. They went out of their way and made me feel quite special. The FA asked me if I liked sweet or sour and soon came back with a special drink which he'd put dry ice in to make it bubbly! Then later they lent me a complimentary movie player. They were small gestures but really made my day. The service was great.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,D Dahlin,3rd October 2011,On return flight from Maui we sat in the first row behind 1st class. My wife needed to use the restroom and must use a crutch to walk so she went forward to 1st class. I went to the back but was blocked by 10 people in line who were blocked by the serving cart so I returned to the front. My wife had returned to her seat and another lady was going through the door so I waited. Then a lady attendant seeing me waiting told me I must go to the rear. I explained that the aisle was blocked by the serving cart she insisted I go back which I did. After the long wait on the serving cart I finally reached the restroom. When I returned to my seat the man in the aisle next to me asked why I went back. He said while I was gone 3 people had passed him and used the front bath room without any harassment. I realized that this restroom is intended for First Class but at the same time a little reasonable attitude and common sense by the attendant would be appreciated.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Jerry Chen,10th September 2011,San Diego to Seattle return. The overall trip was excellent. The crew were nice and gave me a free extra snack. My carry-on was 2 inches larger than the maximum but the gate agent offered to consider it check-in luggage for no extra cost. Only negative point is that both landings were hard especially at San Diego.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,B Swanson,22nd August 2011,Burbank CA to Seattle WA. My mother is quite elderly staff were very courteous from the moment she exited the car. She was supplied with a wheelchair with and pushed by a staff member to both the ticket counter and security without waiting and then helped onto the plane. The trip went without a hitch.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,T Fitzpatrick,22nd August 2011,Flew nonstop Oakland to Kona. Its a much smaller plane than Hawaiian or United for example but seat size is the same. However there are no movies and music they will rent you small hand held pads. They only use one food cart in coach so if you are at the back you will wait over 1 hr after service starts. Food is reasonably priced. Staff are nice and helpful if you know what to expect its fine.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,K Castle,18th August 2011,The airline did got us to the destination however they re-assigned our seats upon check-in - to the lavatory row. I paid full fair for these tickets and spent 6.5 hrs with people standing next to us. When I asked to have my family back in their original seats I was told there was an equipment change. Apparently the computer runs the airline. The computer reassigned the seats and there is nothing a human can do to rectify the situation.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,F Tsang,17th August 2011,Bellingham to Las Vegas return. The flight was great and they provided us a free snack and drinks. Seats were comfortable crew are very friendly. Both flights were on-time. The only negative is that don't have enough check- in counters and staff at Bellingham it was a mess lining up.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,C Duckett,15th August 2011,MFR-PDX-LAS. Adequate flight to Portland with Horizon. Limited service and bumpy ride in crowded Bombardier. Great flight with Alaska in First after chaotic boarding at Portland. Pleasant cabin and comfy seat. Inflight service good drinks flowed freely though the meal wasn't to my taste.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Stephen Spencer,11th August 2011,Puerto Vallarta from Los Angeles. Its only a 3 hr flight. We paid full price First Class not upgrades. First Class it was not. Besides the 737-400 being old and tired my seat was broken both ways. Seat pitch is the tightest I've ever experienced it was impossible to get up with the seat in front reclined. Food was awful there were zero amenities and pre-flight beverage service was water. I had to wait behind coach passengers to use the lavatory both ways despite the announcements alerting passengers about the usage of the front lavatory. The one bright spot was the use of their Board Room Lounge at LAX. Its very nice wonderful staff and plenty of amenities. Alaska needs to upgrade their First Class or go ahead and rip out the four abreast seats up front.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,8,Frank Mauz,7th August 2011,"BLI-HNL on 737-800. ALOHA card on seat with ""Here's the Flight Plan"" on one side and ""Island Trivia"" on the other side sets the Hawaiian mood. Complimentary macadamia nuts and mai tai near arrival leaves a good impression. FA's efficient served free juices and cookie. Does not compare with international flights on Asian carriers but about as good as can be expected nowadays on a domestic flight.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,John Seadler,30th July 2011,San Jose to Spokane Washington. Flight out of San Jose was delayed the agent assured me I would make my connecting flight. We landed and my connecting flight was on time I ran across the airport only to be told the plane had left already. There no apology for the delay or missed flight staff were surly at the gate. Instead of responding to my concerns with some empathy and trying to make a positive difference they went out of their way to make it worse. I've never had this kind of experience with Alaska in the past and I fly with them fairly regularly.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,4,W Finck-McNeill,29th July 2011,"SEA to LAX. We were seated in first class row 1. When we tried to stow our carry on bags the crew had their stuff in our overhead. This forced us to use the overhead behind us which held those people's bags. Plus we got dirty looks from them. The same happened our return trip. We were appalled when coach customers lined up to use the 1st class restroom - why don't the attendants stop the coach from using the 1st restroom. When we pay for first class tickets we are paying for these ""Perks"" or so we thought. It is not our job to tell coach people the rules. It is Alaska Air's job to enforce them.",,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,3,Michael Adams,29th July 2011,We flew to Maui from PDX return - flight over was great the flight back seemed to be on a different airline. The attendants were rude and had no desire to accommodate even a very simple request. Also we paid for our bags going both ways and were only supposed to pay going one way that was an extra 40 bucks. We could have just carried them on like so many others. We paid the 14 bucks for a digiplayer but the headphone quality was so bad we couldn't hear anything. We were finally watching a movie that was very old not a new release as advertised but with 15 minutes left in flight and 5 minutes of the movie they took it away. Overall the return flight was a very inattentive and miserable looking crew.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Bruce Epis,28th July 2011,San Jose to Kona First Class. The seats are not First Class standard. The food was awful and the crew were rude. Also our First Class bathroom always had a line as they opened it to coach class. Something I have never seen on any other domestic airline. There are no First Class lounges in San Jose or Kona.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,Andrew Smith,26th July 2011,LAX-YVR Economy. Boarding was a little chaotic and confusing as the announcements were not made clearly and sometimes hard to hear in the big departure hall at LAX. Staff seemed pretty laid back but were generally helpful. Nice to see an airline that still serves free snacks and drinks. 737-800 was in average condition with pretty basic interior decor.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,N Strehlke,24th July 2011,I booked an Alaska flight for a short trip to San Jose CA from Los Angeles. I have never had an experience like the one I did on the return trip. 10 mins into the flight the cabin told us that due to a high volume of air traffic we would likely be delayed about 15-20 mins and would have to circle over LAX while waiting for a runway to open up. We end up circling over LAX for about 30 mins which wouldn't have been a big deal either except that we didn't land at LAX we landed at Long Beach about 30 mins away by car or 1hr 30mins with LA traffic). Then sat on the tarmac at Long Beach for nearly 2 hrs this is a 1 hr and 20 min flight to begin with and was given no information whatsoever about the airline's plans for us. When certain passengers were permitted to debark they were informed that they would be unable to retrieve their baggage from under the plane and would only be allowed to take their carryon out. Most of us had figured that the airline would probably shuttle us over to LAX. Word comes over the loudspeaker that we're flying back to LAX and will be there in about 1hr. I was expecting to meet an Alaska Airlines representative to explain to us that we would all get vouchers for cabs missed flights etc. no such luck. Not only did no one make an effort no one was even around. I couldn't find anyone from the airline other than the uninformed pilot and stewardesses. In the scheme of things delays like this happen and are sometimes unavoidable. What I don't get is how an airline can turn an hour and a half into 4 hrs by failing to plan ahead.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,T Gilmore,20th July 2011,SEA-YKM on Horizon (connecting to international flights in SEA) but I have been a customer for over 15 yrs. The interior of their planes is standard but their service is what puts them above other American carriers. Numerous times when flying out of YKM and connecting in Seattle to Continental Delta BA etc they have waived second bag fees. Ground staff gate staff and FA are all helpful and genuinely want to make your trip easier. On their longer domestic flights Alsaka still has the full service feel that was the norm in the early 90s. What really sets the apart is that twice now my flight to YKM has been cancelled or forced to return to Seattle due to freezing fog and both times I have been given a full refund without argument from the call centre staff. Highly recommended by a very loyal flyer.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,4,L Green,25th June 2011,Flew first class from Seattle-Chicago this week and was shocked at the poor cabin service. Cabin crew were ambivalent and made us feel unwelcome. The lunch offering - a bowl of soup a bread roll and salad - was very meagre. A very disappointing experience.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,H Monreal,23rd June 2011,In general Alaska Air has been my number one go to airline. They have been customer service oriented for as long as I can remember. The only bad experience I had was when I had MVP Gold status. I called the then Horizon MVP line and asked to have my husband seated next to me. They refused since he was not an MVP Gold. So I called the Alaska MVP Gold number and they put him next to me no questions asked. As for booking I recently booked a vacation through Alaska and had a difficult time. It would not pull in any of my account information from either my personal or EasyBiz account so I had to enter it all manually. Also unlike when you book just a flight you cannot pick your seats in their vacation page. I found both of these items to be frustrating. I doubt I will book a vacation through their site again. I will do everything separately.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,M Boron,13th June 2011,I was a little surprised to read the negative reviews of Alaska. I have always flown them and almost always satisfied and comfortable. Most recently I went Juneau to Kona and back with no complaints. I have found them better than other American carriers I have flown. Also of note due to flying in bad weather in Alaska most of their planes have cutting edge navigation technology in the cockpits.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,B Parker,4th June 2011,"Los Angeles-Vancouver on 737-400. Attempted check-in at kiosk but unless you have a US or Canadian passport you need to check-in at the counter. Staff neither rude nor friendly just robotic. Boarding a bit chaotic as passengers push aboard to hog overhead lockers with their gigantic carry-on bags. Was greeted at the door by a flight attendant's back. I said ""hello"" but no response. Proceeded through first class and waited patiently while passengers blocked the aisle stowing their carry-ons. I was happy to wait however a flight attendant shoves her hand in my face and shouts ""wait right there!"" I wasn't even moving! Walked past the first two rows of economy and noticed that they were smashed to pieces with a sign hanging that said ""do not use"". Not a good look. Airplane was totally full and the interior was showing it's age. Drinks and food for purchase served by frowning unenthusiastic cabin crew. Flight arrived on time baggage delivery fast. In the end they get you where you're going but like most North American based carriers staff are rude and unfriendly.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,K Worley,28th May 2011,We paid to fly First Class from Portland to Hawaii. Seats aren't much better than coach little leg room and hard seats. Inattentive flight attendants. No welcome drink prior to take off and the cabin was served drinks before we got ours. We used the call button and were told our FA was busy preparing our breakfast. Breakfast was fine. Digiplayer didn't have much of interest to offer. FA's disappeared after breakfast and were gabbing away. We rang again for another drink after about an hour and were ignored. Rang again and were berated for abusing the call button. Will never fly Alaska first class again stick with Hawaiian.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,J Stanton,22nd May 2011,"SEA-LIH-SEA. Flight out was OK. We were allowed to sit in our assigned seats. Hard to sleep because of numerous really loud announcements about buying food joining the frequent flier club signing up for a credit card renting a video player etc. Flight back was bad. When we checked in online the day before our return flight we discovered that Alaska had changed our seats from our nice aisle seats to poor ones. When we called we were told that it was too late to do anything; we should take care of it at the airport. That we had written confirmations of our seats which we had repeatedly reconfirmed meant nothing. At the airport check-in line we were told we had to go to the gate. At the gate we were told it was too late to do anything. The gate agent was apologetic but said ""it happens all the time."" Everyone we talked to basically said ""I don't know why this happened. We are very customer oriented. I can't help you."" Flight back was notable for the sleep robbing announcements to sell the same stuff. Does an airline have to wake everyone up to find out how many are flying on miles so they can sell more credit cards? Couldn't sleep much anyway; seat didn't recline.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,C Lou,15th May 2011,First class Seat 4D on Seattle/Chicago run was horrible coming and going. Like sitting on a concrete bench. Not acceptable for First or Business Class. Also what's with the Board Room restrictions? I suffered a 6-hour delay at O'Hare but American (partner in the lounge) would not let me use the lounge without a Board Room card. With a delay of any length they should give complimentary day passes to premium customers. On the plus side Alaska cabin crews are the nicest in the business and food is really good.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,G Erichsen,25th April 2011,BZN-SIT-BZN. Thanks to having a friend who works for the airline we were able to fly standby over an extended Easter weekend. We got everything we should have had we been paying the regular fare - planes were on time crews were friendly enough baggage was unloaded promptly the snacks were unappetizing the cabins were clean and seating was comfortable enough. We appreciated the efforts of the gate staff in Seattle to keep us informed of seating status on a full flight to Sitka (we were the last ones on the plane). The only complaint I have is a mild one and while not the airline's fault I mention it in hopes that maybe the airline will lobby a bit harder - the waiting area at the Sitka airport past security is cramped and without restrooms or any other amenities and the only food outlet at the airport was closed for the holiday.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,H McTyre,4th April 2011,"ANC-SEA-SFO-SEA-ANC First Class. Outbound uneventful and reasonably good service in First. Back was another story. Surly male flight attendant who was uninterested in serving in First Class. No service for the first 90 minutes of the flight. Service when it appeared was lackadaisical at best. No refills of drinks. Flight crew sat in jumpseats ignoring passengers (including me) who were trying to use restroom. Restroom appeared occupied for long period of time. Turned out the flight crew just couldn't be bothered to turn off the ""locked"" sign for about two hours of a three hour and 20 minute flight. I am looking forward to competition in the Alaska market arriving this summer.",,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Debra Walen,4th April 2011,First class from Sea-tac to Maui and back. My friend did an upgrade for an additional 360$ to join me. Service was no smile food was so so the bathroom had a constant line from the back. I asked for a Mai Tai no! Everyone got a pre-mix at the end of the flight - we got about 10 nuts in a pack (same as coach) with that. I wanted a snack and was told the cheese and fruit plate was for coach only - lucky me they had extra and I purchased it for 7$. The only good things about this flight were the seat (large) and my bags were there. Be advised to bring your own pillow and blanket because Alaska won't give them to you - and my flight was freezing!,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,George Whitehall,27th March 2011,"Had reservations for the family to go on spring break to California from Seattle. Not any more. Because of a computer failure all their flights were cancelled during the time period that my flight was to leave. Of course none of this was announced anywhere even on their website which I checked before we left for the airport. Got to the airport and walked into the ticketing area and huge lines of people everywhere all for Alaska Airlines. After two hours in line a customer service agent came by down the line and told everyone who had tickets for this morning that ""you might as well go home"". She said that all the other airlines were full that it would be 4 to 5 days before people could be rescheduled for their destinations. She did say that ""Alaska Air would waive their normal rescheduling fee"" That was it. No other explanation. If Alaska Airlines wants to pretend they are a big airline they need to quit treating their customers like dirt. What kind of company does not have a back up to their main operating system. The news said that they were updating their system. What company would run an update during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.

Alaska Airlines,,Jo-Ann Leskun,24th March 2011,Going on a flight from Vancouver BC to Los Angeles on Alaskan/Delta air and found out that a checked on bag will cost about $25 each way (there are 4 of us $200 extra) but if I went to Mexico checked bag would be free. Alaska and Delta both stated that was because Mexico is an international destination but the US is not. Really? US Canada and Mexico are on the same continent but how can the airlines say that the US is not international travel from Canada or visa versa? We must depart from the international terminal we need a passport we have to go through customs we can buy duty free products.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,7,Nick Parry-Evans,24th March 2011,SEA-LAS. One of the very few direct flights to Las Vegas from Seattle so choice is very limited. I ask for very little on a short haul flight. There was a free soft drink and the usual packet of indescribable pretzels. Decent seat size and overall a clean aircraft. Landing at McCaron improves any flight as it is one of the best domestic airports I have ever been to. Functional though unspectacular.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes

Alaska Airlines,9,S Featherstone,21st February 2011,LAX-MEX-LAX January 2011. I had not flown on Alaska in quite a few years. This airline is in my opinion better than the average US carrier. B737-800 was clean newish and with pleasant staff warm snack. No baggage fee! Overall I would recommend Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,Paul Roos,15th February 2011,OGG-PDX-LAX and OGG-SEA return. We live on Maui and use both Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines to travel. This is a new market for Alaska and we hope they continue to improve their service. These flights were okay - standard mainland business class. Food was average. Service was good and attentive. What is lacking is a seat with better pitch foot rests and pillows or blankets. Hawaiian Airlines give you a seat with about 140 degree recline leg and foot rests and pillows and blankets. Both airlines are attentive to needs but Hawaiian has the edge with unsolicited water drinks etc. Costwise Alaska charges about $300 less than Hawaiian. For the money and the additional comfort I want Hawaiian is the better deal. But keep trying Alaska.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,K Benveniste,11th February 2011,First class from Atlanta to Seattle. The service was attentive and friendly. The meal on Alaska was beautifully presented flavorful and nourishing.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes

Then midway through the flight we heard ""the system is out of water. There will be no more water to drink and please try not to use the toilets unless necessary - who goes into an airline bathroom unless it is necessary? I am only guessing but I think that if there was no time to get fresh fruit on board or enough water to last the flight perhaps the preventive maintenance wasn't done either.

Alaska Airlines,,H McTyre,18th January 2011,ANC-SEA-SFO-PDX-ANC. Most legs of this multiple leg round trip were relatively uneventful. The nickel and diming poor gate announcements surprise gate changes in SEA etc. have all become expected of Alaska Air. What is unacceptable is how unbelievably uncomfortable and filthy the cabins now are. Alaska has no excuse they're not short on cash. As for discomfort it is unacceptable to fail to pay close attention to climate control on a packed airplane. Usually you're freezing. PDX-ANC leg averaged about 84 degrees for the entire flight. Baggage claim continues to be a joke. Alaska claims to have a compensation program if your bags take more than 20 minutes to arrive. They must know nobody is going to stick around to make a claim for now-worthless Alaska Air frequent flier miles.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,5,E Mabley,18th January 2011,LAX-PDX roundtrip. Service on this trip was better than the last few times I've flown this airline - in other words it went from dreadful to mediocre. Flights were on time and the interior was comfortable enough but inflight service was perfunctory and cold. At least this time I was spared the flight delays dirty cabins mishandled baggage and pitiful customer service I've come to expect of Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no

Alaska Airlines,3,Ingrid Tobar,24th December 2010,Seattle to Kelowna BC and the boarding procedure was chaotic. They boarded three flights at the same time through a single gate. Upon arrival at the aircraft boarding zone there was no clear designation on which flight was which. As a result many passengers boarded the wrong aircraft and had to change planes shortly before departure. The same system applied to loading luggage which of course ended up being lost. At my destination I was told to expect a call from the central luggage department but this never happened. I called and got different versions on the status of my luggage: the first agent said it would be here on the afternoon flight the second agent said it had been scheduled but they were not sure whether it had arrived or not and the third yet most unprofessional representative Linda simply hung up when I asked her if anyone could guarantee that my luggage would be sent on a specific flight. It's sad to see such substandard logistics management for Alaska Air because the in-flight service was outstanding. Undoubtedly I will be sure to avoid this airline on my next trip to Canada.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,G Benson,1st December 2010,SEA-PHX in first class for the holidays. The first leg left an hour late due to the lavs not working. They brought around water and orange juice while waiting the hour on board. Breakfast served was pretty tasty. Return trip left on time drinks served quickly. Dinner also very tasty. Landed back in SEA early and checked luggage was very prompt. All in all Alaska air is improving their first class experience.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,V Cuevas,27th November 2010,Miami-Seattle. The inflight experience was great however it was a different story at the airport. Alaska Air is located in concourse E (or Central Terminal) at Miami Airport. The ticket counter area is small and a very inconvenient part of the airport. Unless you arrive very early for check in the line will stretch to where it will block the entrance to a food court behind the counter the exit path of Concourse E the entrance to a TSA check point and the exit of Customs located just below them. The flight departs from Concourse F and the upside to the airport is that there are only about a handful of flights departing from F that morning so TSA checkpoint a breeze. Boarding process was poor there were no pre boarding announcements and passengers just saw other's making the line to board and assumed it was time to board no matter what row they were in. The cabin crew was attentive and cheerful there was actually space in the overhead bins. The seats were comfortable however seat pitch was terrible! Alaska offers Gogo inflight internet and they rent DigEplayers which come with movies/games etc. The flight was 6 hours 24 mins - I had no idea a 737-800 had such a long range. The meals they served (or sold) onboard were fair at a reasonable price. We had the option for a hot or cold meal. Given the long length of the flight the crew did go around the cabin about 3 times for beverage service.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,C Dickson,18th November 2010,PDX-LAS B737 a pleasurable experience. After a 4 hour wait at PDX we were very relieved to get onto the aircraft.

Alaska Airlines,4,E Mabley,17th November 2010,LAX-BLI one way combination of Alaska and Horizon Air. This flight was better than my other experiences on Alaska/Horizon which isn't saying much. Nothing went wrong but the fare was higher than its competitor Allegiant Air and the onboard service and seating were poor. The unionised drone cabin crew couldn't care less about the customer. Horizon Air's DHC-8-400 props are noisy and uncomfortable. Allegiant Air despite their very inconvenient scheduling offers better service and better value for the money.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,R Tinker,27th October 2010,DFW-SEA-YVR. DFW-SEA sector in first class. Crew were very chirpy for early morning flight wih smiles all round and quick service. Seating ok for domestic First and digiplayers offered free of charge. SEA-YVR with Horizon air. Gate staff pleasant as were crew. 40 minutes after boarding crew were unable to close door and we were deplaned and sent back to terminal where we informed flight was cancelled. Ground Staff were excellent handling the situation and re- booked me on the next available flight with Air Canada.

Check-in went well with assurances that the flight was on time. Then once aboard our plane we sat and we sat at the gate until the pilot informed us that there was a mechanical problem. The passengers were allowed to return to the gate and await the problem's resolution a two-hour delay on a one-hour flight. Although the crew thanked us for our ""incredible patience"" no compensation of any kind was offered! Upon arrival in Portland I sought out a gate agent requesting compensation. She helpfully offered me a $50 travel voucher or 2000 mileage plan credit. The moral of this story-always ask for compensation even if not offered up front.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,yes

I fly with this airline almost every month, due to my mother living in Florida, and, of course, the cost is typically much cheaper than other airlines. I've never had any issues, until this particular trip, when I was charged $100 to bring my daughter and I's luggage onto the aircraft. Mind you, I have never been charged, ever. The lady which charged me, stated there was no one, other than herself, which could stand as a manager to speak with me instead. She was beyond rude when I informed her of my frustration.

Allegiant Air,1,G Read,14th September 2017,"Verified Review | Belleville to Jacksonville . Abandoned passengers in Jacksonville FL 36 hrs before any other airline canceled due to Irma. I can forgive the 'charge for everything', I dealt with the seats that don't recline, I even looked past paying for a drink of water, but abandoning passengers that are facing a hurricane is inexcusable. They canceled the flight from Jacksonville FL to St Louis 36 hours before the airport shut down. All other airlines flying out of JAX that day completed their flights out. The weather was actually beautiful that day. They had even sent the 'check in online' the previous day, so we thought we were set. By the time we got the cancellation notice (about 4 hours before our flight), there were no other flights to be booked there or at any other airport within 300 miles. Fortunately, we had not quite made it to the airport, so we kept our rental car and drove all the way back to St Louis, through all the other evacuee traffic. Spent a total of 22 hrs in the car. We made it just fine, in spite of the add'l $500 in rental car fees, $200 in hotel charges, meal expenses, fuel, etc. What really is upsetting is the 'what if' questions. If the storm had been 12 or even 24 hours away, I would understand better, but Irma did not hit that area until Sunday night. Our flight was due to leave around 1pm on Friday. I cannot verify this, but it may be Allegiant did not want to pay to send an empty plane down to JAX to pick us up. The message we received claimed they canceled the flight due to passenger safety. JAX airport did not close until 7pm Sat night, according to the airport website. We will never use this airline again.

I tried to get on an earlier flight (Thursday instead of Friday) to Cincinnati but that was also cancelled. Allegiant prematurely cancelled several flights, leaving thousands of customers in harms way. I was lucky to be able to get on a last-minute flight through Delta who was bringing in extra planes instead of cancelling flights to help get people out of the dangerous area.

Allegiant Air,2,L Edwards,6th September 2017,Verified Review | Flew Orlando to Youngstown. On a plane that was only 3/4 full Allegiant Air decides to seat my wife in the front of the plane and me in the rear. Why? So they can charge additional fees for seat selection. $9-$23 per person. That's $18 to $46 if my wife and I wanted to sit together on a flight I book for us both at the same time on the same credit card. You just can't justify that. We refused to pay the counter girl who had no empathy. Thankfully the cabin crew allowed us to sit together in one of the many empty groups of seats. I won't ever consider this nickel and dime airline again. Even if the flight was advertised as free.

Allegiant Air,1,Jessica Llewellyn,23rd August 2017,Verified Review | Cincinnati to Las Vegas. Worst experience of traveling I have had! First the plane supposedly had to be downgraded so everyone's seats were wrong and my husband's extra leg room was not available. Then they lost our luggage for the entire trip apparently couldn't find it when I spoke with them on 8/18 and 8/20 (since we got an email that we also had a downgrade for our flight back) and then when I got to the airport they wouldn't let us board until they got a certain amount of volunteers to fly out the next day So we were late to take off. Then I stopped at the baggage area when we finally landed in Ohio again to check on our luggage and found out that they logged our baggage as found in Denver on 8/18 and no attempt was made to contact us at all. We wasted $200 on clothes and supplies in vegas that shouldn't have been. I still haven't gotten refunded for my leg space seats or luggage checked fees for both travel there and back or any communication about when I will be getting it. Instead I get requests for reviews and deals for our next flight. I will never fly this airline again. They don't even have a scanning system for their bags checked. You get what you paid for when buying a cheap flight through an airline with nobody knowing who they are but lesson learned. Do not fly them ever! Save the stress.

The second flight there has been no compensation! Allegiant is known to be delayed 30 minutes but my past two experiences has combined for a total of 10 hours in delays. I don't fly to be delayed, I fly to get to my destination on time. Allegiant has proven this is not a priority to them when they do not even explain to their passengers why we are delayed.

When the aircraft turned on, a loud constant high pitch noise occurred for a long period of time and it was ongoing until dimmed when we left the ground. The seats do not recline and the temperature was freezing cold on the plane; you could see customers bundled up from head to toe all throughout the aircraft. In addition, the flight was delayed 3 hours before departure due to a gas spill. There were no updates over the intercom during the delay so confusion and frustration increased for customers. The one positive comment I have is the flight attendants were friendly and accommodating during a family members plane sickness. However, I do not recommend if there are other airline choices.

She said that this was not an isolated incident-this flight is delayed on a weekly basis. I chose Allegient because I could get a cheap round trip flight to Montana. But once the carry on baggage fees, the cost of buying a seat assignment, the taxes and the weekly parking cost of leaving my car at an inconvenient airport because Allegient only flies out of off-the-beaten-track airports, turns out the price is comparable to flying just about any other airline.

I cancelled my return flight, but they would not refund my credit card, they just issued a second travel voucher for a future flight. I'll probably not be flying within the year and it will expire, and certainly not with Allegiant.

I used them more than once because they are the only airline with nonstop service from New Orleans to Pittsburgh. This latest experience was the worst. My boyfriend was visiting from Australia. We booked a flight on Allegiant to Pittsburgh to visit my sister. At 4am I get a text that the flight was canceled. No reason why. I called to see what they can do for us and spent almost an hour on hold. I finally get through to someone who was so rude right from the start. She would not help with hotel vouchers (we had to be out of our vacation rental that night and had another one booked for when we returned). I asked her to transfer me to her manager/supervisor, she said she didn't have one and disconnected me. I spent another hour on hold to get through to someone else (much kinder than the first but not great). She gave me the option of flying to another city and driving to Pittsburgh but could not give me a refund. I had to call back to confirm if we would take this option because I had to talk with my sister and my boyfriend. We decided to do fly to the other city but they refused give us any kind of voucher or discount for a rental car. The new flight for Cleveland was delayed as well. Neither the ticket counter to the counter at the gate had anyone there. Our flight home was delayed and the flight attendants on both flights were horribly obnoxious and rude. They issued a$100 voucher for our inconvenience but I did not find that acceptable considering how awful the ordeal was. I emailed several times, no answer.

Allegiant Air,1,W Edwards,28th July 2017,"Verified Review | I flew from Austin, Texas to Cincinnati, Ohio through Allegiant. I chose Allegiant because they have a non-stop flight from Austin to Cincinnati and it seemed convenient. When I got to Cincinnati my flight landed at 10.33pm. I left the gate and immediately went to baggage claim and double checked with the Allegiant that I was waiting in the right spot. It took a minute for me to get their attention because the employees were in mid conversation with each other. I waited for about an hour and a half and began to get worried because that's a long time to be waiting for a bag. So at around midnight I went to the Allegiant help desk but there was no one there. I was able to chase down one of the employees as they were leaving to go home I imagine and she was very short and irritated that I was asking about my bag. I have flown a lot and I've never had to wait for a bag for so long so naturally I was worried. One of the other employees was walking by with my bag headed towards the desk so I went and claimed it and asked her where it was. She also was very irritated and said ""I pulled it off the carousel"" and walked away. The staff were very rude, the seats were extremely cramped, and waiting for a bag for an hour and a half is ridiculous. I chose Allegiant because the non-stop flight was convenient but I will never fly with them again based solely on how rude the desk help was and the long wait for my luggage.

My most recent trip was scheduled to depart Asheville at 6:45pm on Monday and was rescheduled for 12:00pm on Tuesday. Due to the fact that I had several Tuesday morning work meetings planned, the Tuesday option was no option at all, so I had to rent a car and drive from AVL to ATL to catch a flight with an airline that has a better track record for getting people where they need to go in a timely manner. For the costs of a rental car from AVL to ATL, the costs of a last minute Delta flight, the costs of my time, and the expense of my sanity, I could probably have flown Delta First Class for all of my previous Allegiant flights and still have come out ahead. While the automatic $100 voucher is a nice gesture (that nowhere near covers the actual cost of the incident) I am afraid I have very little use for a $100 voucher to fly on an airline I have zero confidence in.

Allegiant Air,1,C Saunders,18th July 2017,"Verified Review | Undoubtedly the worst flight I have ever experienced. We experienced three departure delays, for various aircraft-related mechanical problems, which made our departure 6 hours late as well as our arrival in Knoxville. Allegiant Air, as required by FAA regulations, provided us 1 cup of warm water (during our last delay while sitting on the tarmac), and approximately a 2-ounce serving of Chex mixed with two tiny pretzels. Allegiant Air's website stated the flight departed at 12.00 noon, and arrived at 3.45pm. The stewardess stated we would receive vouchers from Allegiant Air, which I did tonight. They are for $50, are valid only for a future flight on Allegiant Air, and must be redeemed within 1 year. They are the only airline that flies that route - a 1 hour 40 minute flight, and would not have another flight for three more days. Their required policy submitted to the FAA states that they do not compensate excessive delays, which does seem to comply with Federal regulations. They classify delays resulting from mechanical problems as ""a delay resulting from situations beyond their control"" such as would be severe weather, control tower equipment problems, etc. My previous experiences with Allegiant Air had delays of usually about 1 hour, but the savings seemed to justify those delays. Their seat configurations favor adults with less than a 30"" inseam. I cannot envision flying this airline again except under the most extreme circumstances. Even then I cringe at the thought.

(18 yrs) and (11 yrs) and we decided it would be fun to have them come stay with us for a week during the summer. The brothers live in Anaheim and I saw the tickets on Allegiant Air for a very good price out of Los Angeles so I booked them. They have never been on an airplane before, but they are 18 yrs old and 11 yrs old so I thought everything would be just fine. They arrived at the LAX airport 2.5 hours early and checked in just fine, I received an email stating they checked in, bags were checked in. I guess they got held up in security, when they got to the front of the security line they told them they had 13 minutes to get to their flight. After they were done being searched they had 3 minutes to get to the flight. They asked the TSA staff where the gate was and he told these boys to go to the gate in the opposite direction, so they missed the flight. They did not have a phone and had to borrow a phone to try to find someone to drive 3 hours back to get them. How do you check in 2 boys and not make sure they are on the plane? While I am sitting here in Idaho waiting for them, I get a message telling me they are not on the flight, and they do not know where they went. I was in the Idaho Falls airport and I asked the security guard if he could help me locate them by contacting someone in security at the LAX airport to make sure the boys were ok. He told me no and had me go stand in the Allegiant line. I waited patiently in line and finally up to the front to talk to the lady at the desk. I started to tell her what was going on and that I did not know where the boys were and she did not say a word - and put up a sign that said the line was closed. I finally got to talk to the man who handed me a piece of paper with a 800 number on it and told me to call and talk to them. I called the number and it told me I had a minimum 45 min wait to speak to a representative. I did pick up the boys luggage that was checked in and sent (without them) so now I have the luggage and my boys do not get to spend the whole week as we had planned. Allegiant told them to come back on Friday and they will let them on the next plane out of there. Yes 4 days later.

I was just charged $50 at the gate for a carry on bag. This is for the same little backpack that fits under the seat with plenty of room that I have taken on every single flight with them. I have never been charged for it. If an airline is going to have different policies at different airports they need to notify customers of that. The people sitting next to me have larger bags by their feet and were not charged.

Allegiant Air,10,J Johnson,5th July 2017,"Verified Review | Fort Walton Beach to Cleveland return, which apparently is only a seasonal route. The airline offers a no-frills service. When you buy your ticket you get a seat at a very reasonable fee. If you need more space you have the option to buy more at that time for a fee. If you decide later to bring more luggage, that decision will cost you a few dollars more. When you purchase your ticket, the airline will assign a seat at check in. If you need to have a specific seat, you can purchase that seat for a fee. The airline boards in about 6 or 7 zones, based on seat assignments. If you are the kind of person who likes to get on early, you can pay for that as well. Lastly, tickets are non refundable, and allow for no changes. So, if you think there is a pretty chance you will need to change you ticket, you had better buy the option to change it for a small fee. The planes I flew were A320s, which seat about 177, no seat back pockets and seats are fixed in place and do not recline. You get no free snacks or beverages, you can use major credit card to purchase snacks and beverages. So that is Allegiant Air in a nutshell. If you can deal with that, it is a great value. My flights were on time, actually one arrived early, and the staff was polite and professional. The airline starts boarding about 45 minutes before scheduled departure, so arrive early; because they do close the door 15 minutes before departure and you ain't getting on. I would fly Allegiant again, and recommend them.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Walton Beach to Cleveland,July 2017,4,5,,,5,5,yes
Allegiant Air,8,Adriana Hernandez,4th July 2017,"Verified Review | We paid $89 to fly with Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to El Paso TX. Our expectations were ""you get what you paid for"" but actually it was far better than we expected. Our flight was supposed to be departing at 7am, it was 7.40am when we departed but it wasn't the airlines fault and they kept us informed about the situation. We arrived at the airport at 6.15am, the employees were friendly and when we told them our flight was at 7am they sent us to the front of the line. When checking the bags they were supposed to weigh 40 lbs and we ended up with 42 lbs, they didnt charge us any extra fee. It was a really good experience and we will fly with them again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to El Paso,July 2017,3,5,,,5,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,Kittu Sandhu,2nd July 2017,"Verified Review | Worst airline ever. I booked my confirmed ticket to Vegas with my mom and my boyfriend from 27th to 29th June return. And the airline cancelled the the return flight and we all 3 got stuck. And they didn't even have the courtesy to call us or anything. They just sent an email that your flight has been cancelled sorry. We had work the next day and we got to know about our flight cancellations a night before our flight. We all had to call in sick at our work and lost so much money. On top of that they had no other flight that day and not even the next day from Vegas. I mean they had no flight until 2nd of July (no flight for next 4 days). We felt like we are stuck here forever. We made a huge mistake by booking this airline. They gave us $150 compensation when we book flight from them next time. I mean this is not what we want. And I called their customer service the lady was so rude on the phone, I asked her to book another flight for us as it's not our fault that your airline doesn't have flight for next 4 days. She said sorry I can't do anything, you have to book it yourself. And the flight from same day was so expensive that we couldn't afford it (it's was more than 1500 dollars for 3 of us). We were so stressed out and our trip turned into a worst nightmare because of this airline. Then I called this airline customer service again and asked her which one is the closest city where we can take flight for next day. Then she told me there's one flight from Mesa, Arizona next day in the evening. So we told her to book that as we had no other option. We paid for hotels for one more day which cost us $450 dollars because we booked it on spot same day and then we booked a car which was $580 dollars plus fuel that costed us $100 dollars. My boyfriend drove us from Vegas to Mesa-Phoenix airport which was 5 hour drive. It was so stressful and depressing experience for us. We had to go through a lot on this trip. Even we reached Bellingham at 9pm, it took us another 3 hours to reach home as there was huge lineup at the border. Please be aware before you book flight from this airline. We had the worst and stressful experience. We will never book from this airline again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,June 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,3,Joe Wiggins,29th June 2017,"Verified Review | I was very disappointed at Allegiant and Austin-Bergstrom Airport after taking flight 1337 from Austin to Cincinnati Sunday night. There was no mention by Allegiant, warning passengers that the airline was now flying out of the 'South Terminal'. The terminal was a long drive from the main terminal, and anyone not arriving in plenty of time could have easily missed the shuttle from the main terminal to the 'south 40' where Allegiant now departs and arrives. This terminal is primitive at best. There are no jetways; you walk out on the tarmac to the aircraft, then climb a long set of incline ramps to get into the plane. Not fun in Texas 90-100 degree heat; I can only imagine what that would be like in a rainstorm! Any passenger flying Allegiant out of Austin should be warned in advance via your website, email or text message that the airline is now using a remote terminal with very limited facilities. I have taken three flights on Allegiant. On all three flights, the seats do not recline. They barely have padding. Allegiant should warn their potential passengers that their aircraft lack even the most minimum comforts. There is no free beverage service; not even a glass of water. There is no WiFi, or any type of entertainment. Bring a pillow and blanket if you need one, and be ready to sit in the same position for the duration of your flight.

Allegiant Air,1,P Edwards,28th June 2017,"Verified Review | I advise anyone who is thinking about traveling with Allegiant to spend the extra $40 to get on a flight with a competing airline. Our flight from Vegas to Reno was delayed 5 hours eith no estimated time of arrival, there are no gate agents to be found at the podiums to ask questions, communication with the passengers is poor. After being delayed and boarding the plane we had to wait another hour sitting on the plane while they looked at a maintenance issue unfortunately we had to get off and the flight was canceled, the airline offered a hotel for the night but did not provide transportation to the hotel. The voucher was an $8 meal ticket that could only be used at the airport but unfortunately it was 10pm at night and all of the restaurants in the airport had closed. Although it's not the staff's fault the flight was delayed they handled the situation poorly. Gate agents are nowhere to be found and do not inform customers on the situation. Please please do not travel with Allegiant, the crew and staff are very unprofessional and the planes are always have maintenance issues.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Reno,June 2017,1,1,,,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,3,R Robinson,28th June 2017,"Verified Review | Flew from Fresno to Las Vegas and we were delayed over two hours due to a computer reset, they said (but not until we boarded was this explained) and then had to get someone to sign off on it and go through all the check points. Some people had to rebook flights as they were connecting out of Vegas and were missing those connections. Well, we figured this could happen to any airline. However, on the way back the exact same thing happened! That was preceded by an announced gate change from Gate B-6 to Gate A-16, except there is no gate A-16 and we were left to scramble with other passengers trying to figure out where in the heck we were supposed to be, although our electronic boarding passes did eventually get properly updated. That was the third gate change they announced for different flights in the three hours we waited. I've never experienced that with any other airline. When it was time to board, the loud speaker did not work so those of us who paid for priority boarding heard nothing unless you were standing next to the guy speaking. And boarding was a full hour before the flight was supposed to be able to take off. Without word-of-mouth few priority boarders would have made it. But there was no rush because we were delayed once again due to ""computer malfunction"" and another reinspection checklist. We sat on the tarmac for an hour and 40 minutes. Once the plane started it was very slow getting moving, we lost the A/C - 110 in Vegas! - and the exhaust smell was overwhelming because they left the doors open too long. The upshot was the crew was very pleasant to us but they looked harried and exhausted themselves. I'm sure they must be sick of this as I now know delays are normal with Allegiant. The low price that drew us in was anything but after all the added fees. Our $100 tickets each were $260 each when all was said and done. We won't be flying Allegiant again. There is much that needs to be fixed at Allegiant.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fresno to Las Vegas,June 2017,3,3,2,,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,C Sidebottom,26th June 2017,"Verified Review | I was apprehensive to begin with to fly Allegiant from Lexington to Myrtle Beach because of all the mixed reviews, but my family and I took a chance. While in line to check our bags, I received a text saying the flight would be delayed until 3:35 (was scheduled to leave at 1:09). I was not surprised, as I had been warned that that were notorious for delays. However, after getting through the gate, we received text after text delaying the flight for another hour and a half. There were problems with the engine from a return flight - supposedly from a bird getting sucked into it. Long story short, we finally boarded our plane around 6pm. As we got on the plane, the lights were flickering and it smelled strongly of gas. They seated us all and within about 15 minutes, had everyone get back off the plane due to auxiliary power issues. When we got back inside, we had to wait another couple of hours for maintenance to arrive, and thank goodness the problem was fixed and we finally made it to Myrtle Beach after being at the airport all day, 7 hours after scheduled flight time. I will say though, once we were in the air, there were no problems. The return flight was on schedule with no problems. I will not fly Allegiant again. We missed the first day of our beach vacation sitting at the airport all day. We did each get a $50 voucher to Allegiant for all the troubles, but no thanks.

Allegiant Air,10,T Jenkins,22nd June 2017,"Verified Review | Allegiant was one of the better flights I have taken in the last year. While everything is a-la-carte right down to a carry-on bag, to a bottle of water, the price was amazing, the flight attendants were professional, the airplane was new and clean and our flight departed and landed on time. We will fly Allegiant whenever possible as long as the rates and quality service continue to be amazing. My advice - take advantage of paying for the checked baggage or carry when booking or when they email you a flight reminder. Do you know you get one carry-on free as long as it can be placed under the seat in front of you. If you have to store it in the over-head bin then you have to pay. Also, drinks are $2 each, credit card only, no cash. However, I paid $3.90 for a bottle of diet soda in the airport when I could have bought one for $2 in flight.

Flights will be cancelled - not just delayed but cancelled. But they won't be cancelled within a timely manner. You'll arrive to the gate before you get word of anything. First, they'll keep you hanging on to false hope that maybe your flight is only delayed, as they notify you in 30 minute increments to wait 30 more minutes several times over. After several hours of waiting only then will you be told that no, in fact, the flight is cancelled. As in - go home, find somewhere to stay tonight, and come back in a day or two to try again and that isn't even a guarantee.

Never knew how long the flight was because they kept saying the wrong thing and then laughing on the intercom. Doesn't go down well. Then we go on our returning trip; they turn up 20 minutes late at the check-in desk. Signs for check in are the wrong place so people were getting confused.

Allegiant Air,1,Kenneth Brown,14th June 2017,"Verified Review | I will state never fly this airline again after the horrific experience we had this week. We booked a trip with Allegiant to fly from Ogdensburg NY (near our home town of Ottawa, Ontario) to Orlando but it's actually Sanford which is about 45 minutes from the Orlando International Airport and north of the city. Our departure flight was late due to heavy air traffic in the Orlando area; delay of 90 minutes. There is no car rental agency at all in Ogdensburg, so if you happen to get stuck there, you're out of luck! On June 10, we arrived back at the Sanford Airport, having dropped off our rental, and entered Terminal B to check in for our return flight on June 11. It was a clear day. We were greeted by an airport person that advised up before even entering the check-in line that our flight had been cancelled, and we would need to go to Terminal A (?). Once we walked all the way over there, we were in a line with all the other passengers from the flight. Two employees were at the counter. It took us over an hour to reach the front only to be told the flight was not rescheduled and we could fly home on Wednesday! No offers of anything other than a voucher to fly again with Allegiant for the missed flight; not the total. All this resulted in us having to book another car; drive to Orlando; book a JetBlue flight at $1000 to Syracuse; rent another car in Syracuse; drive to Ogdensburg to pick up our car, then back to Watertown to drop off the 3rd rental of that day and drive home; arriving in Ottawa at 6:00 a.m. the following day! With flights and cars, the added cost was $1500! So much for a $69 airfare to Sanford! I could have flown business class from Ottawa on a major airline for less than it ended up costing us to fly Allegiant. I have tried several times to call the number listed on a slip of paper the airport employee handed us after our hour-long wait. I would caution anyone this is even remotely thinking of traveling with this airline to think twice. a major airline, you would be flying into and out of major airports where other airlines would be available, and partner airlines possibly available to help you get home. With Allegiant, they fly into 'fringe' airports that only cater to just them or them and a few other charter airlines (as in Sanford). They cancelled their flight with absolutely no explanation to passengers, and no rescheduling.

Lady at the desk says that the reason for the flight delay this time is due to bad weather in Cincinnati, which is strange because my husband is in Cincinnati and says the weather is 83 and sunny.

Allegiant Air,1,A Andrews,11th June 2017,"Verified Review | Worst airline I had to deal with. We (my wife and I) planned a 7-day trip to Grand Canyon. The flight from Santa Rosa, CA to Las Vegas (flight 569 from Santa Rosa to Las Vegas) seemed to be very convenient. No need to drive to San Francisco, inexpensive. We arranged everything: we booked a round trip flight with Allegiant, a car rental From Las Vegas airport, a week stay at the hotel in Flagstaff, some prepaid excursions. So we were waiting for boarding at the airport, hearing that the boarding starts in a few minutes again and again. Then we got a message that the flight was delayed for an hour. About an hour later, it was announced that the flight was canceled (without rebooking) for technical reason. We were not offered any option to have our flight rebooked with Allegiant or any other airline even we were ready to fly from any another other (San Francisco or Oakland) Bay Area airport. We have so many things scheduled (and paid for) already. We were told: ""go to SFO or OAK and try to book another flight by yourself"". We only got two $150 vouchers that we could use with Allegiant Air. Those vouchers are worthless since we are not going to fly with this airline. Never again! Money paid for the reservation for the roundtrip with the airline is supposed to be refunded (including car rental). At least Allegiant Air customer service representative told us so. It is still too early to confirm if we get all the money we paid during our booking with Allegiant. It may take a few day to confirm if we got our money back. But what about all other expenses? A week worth of taken vacation time, the hotel reservation that was too late to cancel, pre-booked excursions. I am not even talking about small things like driving to airport, paying for parking. Any normal airline would at least pay cash for ""inconvenience"" and would rebook a flight with another airline, pay for the hotel. As I said earlier we would be OK with driving to San Francisco or Oakland and fly from there. No company have the right to treat its customers like this.

I had also booked two tickets, but the seats were placed in different rows, even though the rows we were seated in were not full. The airline refused to change the tickets to accommodate. For most airlines that is an automatic. Then, when boarding, flight staff tried to force us to put our carryons under the seat, saying only pre-paid carryons were allowed in the overhead.

Allegiant Air,2,E Read,31st May 2017,"Verified Review | Flew Allegiant Air from Cleveland to Orlando Sanford. No greeting by any of the staff on the plane when boarding and landing. The only communication was asking to purchase a beverage and a 10 minute sales pitch to the entire plane on applying for their credit card. The plane was not clean and the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The boarding process to and from our destination was long. Our return flight was just as unfriendly as coming down. The only difference was the speech for your credit card was half as long. Again, no greeting boarding or exiting the plane. I understand its a low cost flight but they charge for everything. The check in of $40 is crazy. We paid the $15 to carry a bag on and was limited to bag and my purse. Then you play for your seat, again I get it because that's how you keep costs down. But, to pay $10 for a boarding pass its a bit excessive. I printed from home and luckily the hotel allowed us or we would have been screwed to pay more. No coffee on the plane. We could pay at $2 though. The seats were like sitting on wood. I'm very disappointed and honestly would rather pay a little bit more and not deal with all of this.

Allegiant Air,3,D Pavala,27th May 2017,"Verified Review | I flew recently on Allegiant Air from Cincinnati to Baltimore Washington. I did online check in and everything ahead of time as I am traveling with 2 kids. I stopped at the ticket counter just to drop my checked baggage. My flight was at 7.30 am and I was at the counter at 6.20 am to drop my checked baggage The receptionist at Allegiant air at CVG airport said boarding closed for that flight at 6.15 am, so she can not take my checked baggage. I asked there is 75 mimutes to the flight, boarding supposed to be closed 45 minutes before, why 75 minutes early, she said I dont know. Then the staff from the next counter came and said to her boarding for that flight is not closed until 6.45 am that means I still have 25 minutes. If the other receptionist won't come and correct her what should have happen. It's very annoying what she did to me when I am traveling with two kids, she is not helpful and she is very rude to us.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Baltimore Washington,May 2017,3,1,,,1,4,yes
Allegiant Air,1,Jeff Blair,27th May 2017,Unverified | Las Vegas to Fresno. Got to the airport early due to hotel check out. Would not let me stand by for earlier flight even though seats are available. Would not let me check my bags and go sit in airport club to get work done. Making me sit in the ticketing area for 4 hours before being able to check in when no other airline does this. Their ticketing agents are rude. Their phone customer service is rude. And their overall customer service and policies are severely lacking in treating their customers right. Their customers pay their salaries. Their canned speeches at the end of a flight about having a choice of airlines to fly and they are glad you chose theirs and they hope to see you on a future flight is ridiculous. But they are right. I do have a choice of airlines to fly and I will spend more money or drive great distances to never fly Allegiant again.,,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fresno,May 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,M Razzone,24th May 2017,"Verified Review | Flew from Newark to Knoxville with my family of four. Tickets were $58/per person. Flights are very specific with regard to what days/times they fly to & from locations so you have to be flexible if you want a great deal! Our Thursday flight out of Newark was at 11:57am, because that's the only flight they have on Thursdays. We weren't able to fly home with Allegiant because they're flight between TYS & EWR on a Sunday is a 9am flight (like I said, very specific) and 9am on Sunday morning didn't leave us enough time to enjoy our last day away. So here's the scoop, the seats don't recline, food and drinks are for a fee (nothing is complimentary), and there's a fee to pick specific seats on the plane so your party can all sit together. That all being said, we left on time, the flight attendants were friendly and professional, the ride was smooth, and we arrived 5 mins early. The next time we travel, Allegiant will be the first airline I check with for travel deals. No complaints what-so-ever.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Knoxville,May 2017,3,4,4,,5,5,yes

They loaded us onto our already delayed (by one hour) flight from Las Vegas to Colorado Springs, just to have us sit there for over two hours, when they would come over the loud speaker to inform us of updates. All they would say is that it was due to ""paperwork"". For the first whole hour of waiting, there was no air conditioning provided (mind you we were in Las Vegas so it was hot). They finally gave us Air Conditioning and offered us ""complimentary cups of water"". Absolutely unnaceptable! Not only did we have to sit on the small plane for over two hours but we were not offered anything besides water the whole time or to compensate for our time waited.

Operating from a very small airport in Idaho Falls, they delayed my flight by 1 hr 30 mins. I hadn't a connector from Las Vegas from the other terminal. The inflight attendants and people at gate were rude and did not pass the message that I wouldn't be late for the connector. When I contacted their customers care it took forever to connect and somebody went it's not their job to see whether the connector was made or not. Upon saying I would lodge a complaint the lady went ""we don't care about those"". I wonder with that attitude how are the things still in business. For the record, while I write this review I am waiting in the boarding area for the return flight to Idaho Falls - and it's late by 2 hrs. Till now I have experienced the usual ""we dont care"" attitude. I am trying to be as reserved as possible when I'm reviewing this. It's worse than that.

He was joking about it, but eventually it led to a cancelled flight and setbacks for many. Allegiant believes that their offer of $100 voucher for next time is an appropriate way to handle the situation. I disagree. I like many other customers will end up eating the cost of a day lost that we were supposed to be in Las Vegas and Allegiant offers poor customer support and solutions that I would call satisfactory. While I understand that a safety issue is not a foreseen event, I do not believe Allegiant offered anything close to the value of the costs eaten beyond anything booked through Allegiant.

We did not receive another update for at least 15 minutes, and when we did, the pilot was not sure if we would be able to complete the flight-- maybe, probably, and stuttering occurred, all very reassuring. We took off at approximately 1:15 am to arrive to Asheville, NC around 3am. The flight attendants ran out of water on the plane (we were on it for 5 hours). Once we arrived the people that were force to gate check their luggage seemed to be the last ones standing - oh because they didn't see the luggage.

As I entered the aircraft and found my seat I was told by a flight attendant who was standing across from my seat to place my carry on bag under the seat. I had a carry on bag and a personal bag. I told her that carry on which I paid extra for is too big to go under the seat and should go in the compartment above. She said there is no room above my seat. I quickly scanned the upper compartments and saw right there lots of empty space in the compartment above other seats. I place my bag there and made my way to my seat.

On the flight back, we were already delayed about an hour from weather (not the airlines fault there), but about to take off and had to head back to gate because of yet another mechanical issue. Lovely. With all the negotiating of the airports and dealing with this horrible airline, we could have driven down and back for about the same time and paid way less than these ""discount"" tickets.

I have sent multiple messages and tried calling multiple times, and have been unable to reach anyone. In March I had to fly from Oakland to Eugene due to my sister being in hospital. After arriving at the airport my flight was delayed. Then again. Then again. Eventually, after sitting in the airport for hours, it was canceled and I was told I would be receiving a small credit and the possibility (not guarantee) of a flight out the next day. The credit was not even enough for a full trip. Not only was my time wasted, but I then had to buy a last minute flight from SFO in order to make it to Oregon. It also meant that my ~$65 ride to the airport was for nothing. I had to pay for my new flight out. I had to pay to then get from the Oakland airport to the SF airport during rush hour. My family who had already driven two hours to pick me up at the Eugene airprot had to turn around and then drive 4hrs during rush hour to get to the Portland airport where I would now be flying into. And since I had now been at airports nearly all day I had to pay expensive prices for airport food. I have emailed and called numerous times and have never gotten in touch with anyone.

However, after realizing there were multiple open seats I kindly asked if it would be possible to relocate so my daughter and I could sit together. The flight attendant appeared rude and annoyed when replying saying it was an inconvinience as she was counting passengers yet had just accommodated a fellow passenger who requested a window seat. After very reluctantly allowing my daughter and I to move one row up to be together she proceeded to tell us to ""hurry up or get back to your original seat"". She then tossed my sweater at me which I had left back in my original seat. This was a very disheartening and disappointing experience to say the least.

The flight attendant was rude in handling the spill and then proceeded to not take my friend's order. I had a ginger ale and the same flight attendant told me I had to finish it and stood there waiting for me with a scowl on her face. I understand finishing your drink before landing, but 2 more times another flight attendant walked by asking for trash after that, so there wasn't any urgency.

A total loss of $400 plus a whole day of Easter in airports and all they could do is give me a voucher for $100. I have never heard of a 32 hour delay. This is ridiculous!

Nothing was wrong with our plane we just had to wait for it to be cleaned up. However, that took almost two hours with no air on a small confined aircraft with over 100 people. Not once did allegiant offer a drink or snack while we waited and the two men sitting next to me were in the wrong seats and the flight attendant acted like it didn't matter. The flight attendants were rude, and not once offered a drink or snack as we all sat there and sweated. Then, once we finally do get to our destination we have to sit there for another 45 min because they can't get the door open! Awful. I've flown with Allegiant multiple times but this flight was terrible. Very disappointed. I don't expect to have tv or free food on your flight, however I do expect to get a free snack if we are delayed that long and flight attendants don't inform you on anything. Neither did our pilot.

The morning of our flight, we got a text that the flight had been cancelled. Took hours to get through to Allegiant. Received no explanation as to why it was cancelled and an alternate flight was not offered. They did refund our money but we lost a lot of money and time on previously booked excursions and meals. Not to mention my husbands birthday was ruined! They did also give us a voucher towards another flight, which we reluctantly used this past weekend. This past Friday March, 31, 2017, we were to fly out of Wilkes-Barre to St. Petersburg. Our flight was delayed by over 2 hours. Once finally on the plane we were stopped on the runway due to a mechanical issue with fear that we would not even be able to take off. Nearly 2 and a half hours past initial departure time we were finally cleared after they got the mechanical issue fixed. Now to think we are on a plane for the next 2 hours, a plane that just had an issue and couldn't take off. Once in flight, the pilot came over the speaker to tell everyone he apologized for the inconveniences and that the flight was almost cancelled as there was no pilot to fly the plane. Said he came in on his day off to fly it. The plane was dirty and had a terrible odor on it. Was afraid to touch anything. The bathroom was just disgusting. Smelt horrible and had mold near and around the sink and toilet. The only thing Allegiant had going for them was the staff. They were all friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this company to anyone!

Had us de-board the plane, wait for 3 hrs to then tell us we would be given vouchers for taxi and hotel and rescheduled our flight for 3.30pm the next day. The handling of the vouchers was a mess, there were 4 Allegiant staff members behind the counter - 1 of which was sitting down eating pizza. Instead of working efficiently by dividing up the stack of vouchers amongst them, they had 1 person call out names 1 by 1 of every individual on the plane while the other staff members just watched. In general, the staff lacked professionalism, compassion, and competency. To make matters worse, there was only 1 taxi that would accept the voucher. When I notified the Allegiant staff, I was told with a condescending tone that I could just walk to the hotel if I did not feel like waiting. At this time it was 1.30am and 34 degrees outside.

So, a trip I've had planned for quite a while, took time off work and made multiple plans ... ruined. (My twelve-year-old son, not happy.). I am writing this review due to the complete lack of respect the frontline people showed the passengers in this crisis who just had their flight cancelled. They were very short and rude to the passengers in fothe not of me in line to the point that I simply got out of line and left.

Upon us arriving early for our flight we were informed that the flight was initially delayed for 3 hrs. We checked our bags and decided to leave the airport until two hrs before the delayed time. I received an alert on my phone saying my flight was rescheduled for the next day. No explanation, just a text. I later received a call from someone stating the flight was ""rescheduled"" and when could I come and get my luggage. I informed the customer service rep that I had to rely on someone else for transportation since I had already turned in my rental car. They stated ok. I received two more calls from the rep stating that I could come and get my luggage within 10 minutes or come at 8.30pm when someone returned to the ticket counter. I went back at 8.10pm awaiting the arrival of a customer service rep. No one ever came. I waited for over an hour only to finally get in contact with an employee who stated that I would have to get my luggage the next day because no one was returning to the airport that night!

Allegiant Air,1,John Costas,14th March 2017,"Verified Review | First time flying Allegiant Air from Trenton, NJ to St. Petersburg Fl. The flight attendants are rude, the seats are very uncomfortable, the tray tables are half the normal size. Flight was delayed without any explanation. When I asked the flight attendant when does she expect us to land in St. Petersburg, her response was depends when we take off. I asked when does she expect us to take off, she said depends on how fast we board. But once we take off the flight time was 2 hours and 38 minutes. My only reason for asking was for me to coordinate my pickup ride at the airport and since they did not update the flight status on line or texting it was completely unknown. No consideration and complete lack of customer focus. Last time I checked being curtious did not cost anything extra.

I have travelled with all airlines from around the world both domestic and international. No airline has been 7 hours late, not updated their website even hours before the flight to advise their passengers. They admitted they knew the day before the flight from Bellingham to Las Vegas would be delayed but never thought to inform their paid customers. Even further they have a flight departing from the same airport to the same destination leaving on time 3 hours after our originally scheduled time and arriving on time yet our flight is to be told we will arrive 6.5 hours later than them.

Were first informed of a delay 2 hours prior to scheduled departure. The delay was increased 3 separate times until eventually a 7 hour delay. Instead of accommodating our flight with an earlier plane, (plenty of empty planes on the ground in Mesa,) Allegiant does what it does best - mess their customers around, making them wait so they can save a buck.

The 2 concourse employees plus the two agents at the counter were shabbily dressed and those at the concourse were eating and drinking at their kiosk in plain sight of the customers. Once onboard we were very professionally greeted by the 4 flight attendents! The lead gave the usual intructions preflight but spoke in such a rapid manner it was very difficult to understand him. When beverage service began I put my tray down only to see it was filthy with crumbs and greasy fingerprints which I brought to the attendent's attention. She did immediatley return with a clean wipe and cleaned my tray. I noted that crumbs were all over the floor in front! All 4 attendents were very professional and neatly dressed. The pilot and copilot never came out of the cockpit to thank the passengers for flying Allegiant as very usual on all flights. I must congratulate the ground crew at VPS for their rapid unloading of our luggage for it was the fastest I have ever encountered! By the way, my flight number was 684VPS on 3/06 and my seat allocation was zone 3 seat 10E. We were informed was only 1/2 filled but we were not allowed to change our seats because of ""security"" reasons. I much prefer a window seat.

Yes, flight attendants are just as good if not better than some I have flown with. Would definitely fly again. We were delayed on our initial flight out of RDU to MSY for Mardi Gras due to mechanical issues, but that happens to every airline.

This is probably my tenth time flying them and I continue to be impressed. Yes, they are an ultra-discount airline which means that you pay for any necessary add-ons. When you do your reservation on-line, you will see all the added fees before hand and not have any sticker shock at the airport. My round-trip from Concord, NC to St. Petersburg took place without a hitch. Both flights were on-time. The crews (except for one surly-faced flight attendant on the flight down to St. Petersburg) were all polite and professional.

If the plane is fixed"" - If! ""We don't really know what's going on"". I would not be worried if I knew that Allegiant would pay for a hotel if it never gets fixed, but everyone says they won't.

The plane is no frills but I came prepared with snacks and ipads and crafts for my kids to pass the time. On the return flight we were supposed to get a huge snow storm at home. Allegiant cancelled the flight around 12 pm when our flight was set to leave at 7 am. I received a text and email which was nice and a few minutes after that another one with the new flight info.

After a whole day spent at the airport, being told the plane would be leaving at 1, then 3, then 4.30, then 6. What was originally supposed to be a 10:25 am departure, ended up in a wasted day, tears, and heartache. In the end, I ended up not going at all because I had already missed the funeral that started at 5pm. They refunded my money and gave me a $50 voucher for another time. To me, this does not even begin to make up for the heartache and stress they caused me and my family today. I am so severely disappointed in how this airline handled the issue. They didn't update the flight info, they waited for hours to update anyone and they were only offering flight vouchers but no refunds.

First, our flight was delayed, but they emailed and texted us almost 2 hours before to let us know that would be the case. It happens, we appreciated the heads up. We were a little disappointed by the absolute now frills and nickel and diming that the airline does, but that's what you get with a low cost airline. Our big hiccup came when we landed in Las Vegas and found out that our bags had not been loaded on the plane. That meant that my wife and I, and our 3 year old and 1 year old had nothing (Due to charging for carry-on's we chose just to check everything). We were on vacation for 10 days and it took them 7 days to get our bags and car seats to us. But before I condemn anyone, Allegiant did right by us. They told us to go out and buy what we needed and they would reimburse us. Obviously we were skeptical, especially as the days went on without us getting our bags or car seats. But when all was said and done, they did reimburse us and we got a weeks worth of clothes out of it. It wasn't an amazing experience, but they did what they could to make it right.

Like many others, I was enticed by the so called ""low airfares"". Soon thereafter I realized that it was all a facade. I had already paid $25 to check a bag and was told I had to pay an extra $50 because my luggage was 5 pounds over the weight limit. So in essence I paid $75 to check one bag. This is absolutely ridiculous! The lady at the ticket counter showed no sympathy whatsoever as she responded in her robotic, uncaring voice. When I got on the plane I realized you have to pay for any snacks-$3 for a small box of M&M's! At one point in the trip, the flight attendant whacked my knee cap quite hard with his service cart, hard enough to make me scream out. He asked if I was all right but continued rolling the cart down the aisle, not even waiting to hear my response. Nor did he even come back and apologize or ask if I was doing OK. And the button to recline my seat was absent, so I remained upright the whole three hours of flight time.

To take a shuttle through them it would cost over $200 dollars to get to and from the hotel. Then they offer park passes to Universal Studios. So I purchased them. Well the hotel is in Disney the hotel does offer a shuttle to Universal.

My flight back to Vegas was cancelled outright as we were all supposed to board. No compensation and the earliest flight they could get was the next day at 5pm.

Allegiant Air,1,Rachel Moon,27th January 2017,"Verified Review | Casper, Wyoming to Las Vegas return. Our experience with Allegiant was terrible from start to finish. Our flight was delayed in Casper for nearly 3 hours, and the ""manager"" (I use that term very loosely) was unaware of the delay until informed by passengers on the plane. She was extremely unprofessional, as were the other employees working the check in counter. They were talking loudly amongst themselves, eating and drinking and goofing off while there were people in line, waiting to be checked in. They could barely be bothered to even converse with the customers. After we finally made it through security, this ""manager"" was completely confused as to why everyone was now waiting at the gate. She was sitting in a wheelchair (one that is intended for handicap passengers, as she has no walking impediment) wheeling herself and kicking herself around the terminal in said wheelchair, all the while addressing the passengers and others in the room, making sure we were aware that she was indeed the manager and that she was completely unaware and uninformed about when the plane would arrive and what was causing the delay to begin with. It was then learned amongst the passengers in the room that this ""manager"" had called several of the passengers of the plane and informed them of the delay and then we had an extended wait time because those passengers hadn't arrived yet. Once on the airplane we had a horrible ascent, and descent. Once we arrived at our destination, we arrived 3 hours passed our schedule arrival time. Because of this, our car rental reservation was canceled and we were stranded in Las Vegas with no car and no cell phones. On the return flight, our flight time was moved up by 2 hours without our knowledge and we nearly missed our flight, and after rushing everyone onto the plane, we proceeded to sit on the plane and wait for them to ""fix"" whatever was wrong for the aircraft for the next hour, at which time we now needed more fuel prior to take off.

The airline staff was rude after we found out the airplane couldn't land due to fog in Stockton. They get on the announcer to tell everyone that they will provide water but just some water and if you wanted a bottle you would have to purchase it. No water, no snacks throughout the flight and with the airplane in hold mode in the air for another good hour before flying to next airport to refuel. They go skimpy on water? People were up in the morning at 4am to get to the airport and board at 6am. Not thinking we don't get water or even a snack. It would have been bettter if the lady that made the announcement was a bit more human instead of a person that sounded like they only cared about making a sale. We land a new airport only to be delayed 2 more hours before flying back to Stockton CA. Get back on the plane and staff again (same people) sounded like they dont care anymore. They had to do a head count. 3 members did the count and had different numbers! I guess they couldn't do basic math. How do you mess that up. Its not like anyone got up and did some magic trick to play with them. So we sat on the plane another good 20 mins before take off. Passengers were getting very restless at this point after all the delays. A two hour flight turned into a 8 hour ordeal! I can keep going on and on about them but I wont.

Allegiant Air,1,T Ellis,11th January 2017,"Verified Review | My family (Husband, 15 month old daugher and myself) flew from Kansas City to Las Vegas on 12/22. Our flight attendant was more than rude and unprofessional. We were seated in the first row on the plane. We had bought our 15 month old her own seat so my husband, our daughter and myself had our own space. Our daughter was having trouble adapting to a confined space and was having a meltdown. My husband and I were trying everything we could to help soothe her during our initial taxi. The FA was on a huge power trip. Traveling with a toddler is stressful and not pleasant for anyone. She was lecturing us and talking down to us the entire flight was unnecessary and in poor taste. I was on the verge of tears by the time we landed because she wouldn't stop meddling in our situation. On our way home, we flew from Las Vegas to Rapid City, SD on 12/27. The universe must've been working against us since the same FA was on our return flight. This time my husband was seated in the exit row and my daughter and I were seated catty-corner behind him to his left. During initial prep, the FA had asked the exit row customers the routine ""incase of an emergency"" questions. My husband answered yes, he was willing and able. Half way through our flight my husband and I had traded spots as we switched off entertaining our daughter. One FA stopped at the exit row and told me I would need to pay for the seat if I was going to sit there. I explained to her we had already purchased the seat and were switching for a few minutes. The FA proceeded to make her way back to plane a few minutes after my conversation with the first flight attendant. She told me I wasn't allowed to sit there as she didn't initially brief me. I told her I understood and that I would switch seats with my husband. She returned 2 minutes later and had asked me if we had paid for the seat my daughter was sitting in. I said ""yes."" I'm upset because as a lead flight attendant, it's her job to know which seats are vacant and half way through a flight she was questioning us. 3 minutes pass and she approaches my husband who is now back in the exit row. She explains to him that she didn't brief him during the initial briefing and that he would need to be reseated. She also mentioned that if something were to happen during the flight and the FAA were to find out she allowed someone to sit there who wasn't briefed, she would be in a lot of trouble. To me, this all sounds again like her problem and again not knowing which seats are paid for and occupied. My husband said he would be reseated. She then proceeded to tell him that he wasn't allowed to move because the seat belt sign was on. So she briefed him while standing there and asked for a verbal confirmation. She then ended the conversation with ""in the future, don't sit in an exit row."" For the later half of our flight, she 3 times came back to talk to us and made us feel like we were trying to short change the company by stealing seats. She was on a complete power trip and was very unprofessional. In the future, I will pay double the amount of money to fly on a better and classier airline that Allegiant.

Allegiant Air,1,S Daniels,11th January 2017,"Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale to Cincinnati. Allegiant Air got everyone on board, but before take-off the captain informed us a service light came on which required maintenance. This problem took over an hour to be fixed, the captain gave insufficient updates and let the cabin get extremely hot for long periods of time. Just an overall terrible experience. Flight attendants were not in proper uniform, shirts torn up, not tucked in, one attendant appeared as if they didn't want to give any instructions.

We had reserved side by side seats, but our plane broke down they gave a substitute plane and separated us! We paid for premium and found our car was booked but not paid for! Enterprise doesn't accept a debit card for a one way rental and they don't take cash. We were stranded at the airport. Everything was shut down. Only a drink machine.

My flight from Los Angeles to Tulsa was delayed three hours, then once landed, sat on the tarmac for an hour because the flight leaving out of Tulsa was delayed (shocking) and there wasn't another gate for Allegiant. Apparently they only have one gate. Cut to - my return flight from Tulsa to LAX. Was ""on time"" until five minutes after the flight was supposed to depart Tulsa, then the monitor changed to ""delayed."" Once again, for three hours. Once the flight landed in Tulsa, three hours later (our plane to take us back to Los Angeles), they announced that the flight was cancelled and was being rescheduled for the following day. No time of reschedule, no hotel vouchers. Basically, we can do nothing and we really don't care what you do until the flight is rescheduled.

Engine was fine, landing gear was fine, paperwork was the reason all the passengers boarded half an hour late and took off two hours later. I received a notification that my flight had been delayed while I had already been on the aircraft for an hour and a half. After all that, all food was still for purchase only. I was livid, and it would be okay if this was a one time thing. It has now happened on 4/4 flights.

I believe other postings of Flight 1729 gives a pretty good description of a New Years Eve we will never forget. I believe I take another view on how the crew on the flight and the ground crew handled this event. First if the captain refused to question the inspection we may not be here to complain. The crew did hand out snacks and juice to drink. They used what they had, and kept their stress under control considering the flack they had to endure. We needed to add fuel, because the captain kept the engines running to maintain our comfort. Our cell phones were receiving updates all evening our flight was resumed the next day. Trust me by the time we got to the hotel Allegiant Air put us up in we managed to only get 3 hrs sleep. But the ground crew returned the next morning to check us in, with less sleep. Our compensation $100.00 voucher was not adequate. So hats off to hard working employees of Allegiant Air Grand Rapids.

Allegiant Air,2,K Marriss,2nd January 2017,"Verified Review | Punta Gorda to Rickenbacker. Allegiant Air is not family friendly and staff don't seem to know FAA regulations. It started with the gate agent in Punta Gorda who tried to close boarding 30 minutes prior to departure as I was heating my infant's bottle 10 feet from the gate. She threatened to close the door on me and my family, even though it says they don't close boarding until 15 mins prior to departure. She continued to verbally threaten me for the 5 minutes it took to heat the bottle, which still left us boarding 25 mins prior to departure. Once we boarded the plane, a flight attendant tried to tell us that we couldn't have 2 car seats in the same row on the same side of the aisle, even though regulations say you can as long as the adult sits in the aisle seat. They continued to have us move the car seat 2 more times, once across the aisle and then they decided that wasn't good enough so they asked my husband to take one of the car seats to the back of the plane and seperate our family. At this point they were claiming ""weight distribution"". I demanded to sit with my family, and after further insistence, I and my 2 year old were allowed to go sit with my husband and 11 month old in the back of the plane. On a flight at 7:45am on New Year's Day that was 50% empty. It was clear to me that they were simply trying to relegate us to the back of the aircraft, even though on Allegiant you pay more money for better seats that are more forward in the aircraft. And it was also clear that they either have no clue what the FAA regulations are regarding car seats, or were lying to have an excuse to move us, and I'm not sure which is worse.

The Allegiant Air flight is over 4 hours delayed and still hasn't been cleared to leave due to a mechanical issue. All the flight attendants can offer are water and M&Ms. I have asked every member of the flight crew (including the captain) who to contact about getting reimbursed or a voucher, and all they can point me to is their 1-800 customer service number. It is mindbogoling to me that an airline can get away with not delivering on their service like this. I understand weather-related delays, but this is completely the fault of Allegiant Air and it's airplane. My blood is boiling knowing that I will not be reimbursed a cent for this awful service.

I'm honestly surprised they are still in business. We got to the airport and there were three desk assistants, only one had the slightest clue as to how to assist customers. The other two just seemed to be there for decoration. The flight was pushed back twice and then finally canceled. Everyone was told to go to the desk to get hotel and food vouchers and rearrange flight. The crew could not tell us where we would be staying for the evening, nor when we would be able to fly out, so we weren't comfortable making our own accommodations in the event it was an early morning departure. We waited and we waited at 11 at night with absolutely no information. When one man demanded some information and voiced the ridiculousness of the situation, they called security on him. Then there were so many people being sent to the same hotel, we had to wait over an hour in line for a shuttle. We were told it was just across the street. We finally took a cab. 38 bucks later, it was not just across the street. When we finally made it to the hotel, it was pandemonium. It was like a scene from the twilight zone.

Allegiant Air,1,E Ormsby,26th December 2016,"Verified Review | My family and I were supposed to travel from the Phoenix-Mesa to Idaho Falls, Idaho. Our flight was scheduled as On Time and without delays, but after we boarded we were told to disembark because, according to the flight attendant, the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls wasn't working. We waited in the airport for 1.5 hours before we were told to board the plane again. Everyone boarded and waited on the plane an additional 45 minutes until the pilot said the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls still wasn't working. We disembarked again and this time most of the passengers were anxious for a better explanation. An Alegiant worker finally admitted that the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls hadn't been working for a few days and two Allegiant planes were already stranded in Idaho Falls. Many passengers were frustrated, but all the passengers were told to just leave because no one at the airport could answer any questions. There were people who had to get to work the next day and kids were crying because they couldn't spend Christmas with family that night- including my 10 year-old. What I don't understand is, if the de-icer in Idaho Falls hadn't been working and planes were already stranded there, why weren't we notified before we arrived at the airport? Anyway, I called a number an Allegiant worker had written on a small piece of paper and I waited on hold for over 30 minutes before my wife discovered the number I was given was a generic number. Allegiant couldn't even give me a good number to call, so that I could resolve this issue. After hanging up and calling a different number I was ultimately told the next flight was four days away. I argued for a refund and was given that, including a refund of all the nickel and dime charges Allegiant gets you with (at least the refund was a plus).

So, after driving two hours to get to the airport and assuming that my flight would go smoothly because of the notification on my electronic boarding pass that said ""ON TIME,"" my travel plans were completely ruined. The airline was in no way willing to negotiate, we were not even able to sign a waiver.

The seats on the plane are molded plastic with no capability of reclining, very thin, hard padding and packed so closely that my knees literally touched the seat in front of me the entire flight. I was so uncomfortable that my back started hurting before we even started taxiing. Add to this the constant added charges, checked bags, carry-on bags, selecting your own seat, printing boarding passes etc make it very frustrating to even try to book a flight. Then, they don't even offer a free cup of water on the flight. Any food or drinks are overly expensive and must be paid for by credit card. The attendants, while not rude, weren't exactly pleasant to communicate with. The only good things I can say is the price of the ticket, if you get away without all the extra charges, is very inexpensive, and the location of the terminals is a bit easier to get around in than the larger international airports like Charlotte or Orlando.

However Allegiant would rather scam you out of more money to change your seat just so you can sit with the people you are vacationing with. I would understand if the tickets were purchased separately, but they were not. The flights were not full so there is no valid reasoning for this other than to scam people out if more money. This is the 2nd bad experience I have had with Allegiant Air and I can't think of any good reason to fly with them again. They advertise to be a cheap flight, which if it wasn't for all the hidden costs would be true. The attendents at the gate were extremely rude when we left Las Vegas. A trip should be relaxing, all of it was except dealing with this airline and their rude attendants. Flight 496 to Des Moines from Vegas 12/9/16.

After deboarding the broken plane (an issue which Allegiant is apparently known for because of older aircraft), we were directed off the plane with no further instruction. Eventually they redirected us to another gate and another plane, which was out of fuel. After further waiting on the runway (this plane didn't even have air conditioning even though we were in Orlando), we eventually left over 2 hours after our planned departure time. They left passengers largely uninformed through the entire debacle, and didn't offer any apology.

Because we needed to fly back 2 days earlier we got no refund for our Friday ticket and we both had to purchase 2 new tickets at a cost of double what the Friday ticket cost us. Maybe all airlines do this because of last minute changes? Flight back Wednesday was 1 hour late due to weather in Asheville. It started out to be a good deal for under 300 for 2 people round trip.

If you are flying somewhere and want to fly cheap, Don't pick your seat, don't pack a suitcase and save that fee. I might try them again - just got rubbed the wrong way with the early flight back at a 150% extra fee.

Allegiant Air,10,J Smith,3rd November 2016,"Verified Review | Cincinnati to Baltimore. Allegiant Air is awesome. Their presence at CVG opens up many opportunities to fly nonstop on a limited budget or limited time. One hour in the air versus one day of driving saves me one day of PTO, or a vacation one day longer. I'm a very frequent flier on several airlines, and the value for money with Allegiant is excellent. I prefer a la carte pricing. Since I'm normally carry-on-only, I don't want to pay for someone else's checked luggage, but I'm more than happy to pay a little extra for legroom and priority boarding - both of which were well worth the money. I skipped to the front of the line while checking my bag (the $6 I paid for priority boarding includes priority check-in / bag check), and had enormous legroom in my seat. Frequent flier hack: I found that I could get a cheaper international ticket on a mainline airline out of Washington DC than I could via anywhere in Ohio so I took Allegiant to BWI, then continued on from there to England. Saved $500 that way! On discount airlines (Frontier/Allegiant), I always tip the flight attendants, they are very grateful, and I never go thirsty.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CVG to BWI,May 2016,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
Allegiant Air,7,G Kohn,31st October 2016,"Albuquerque to Los Angeles return with Allegiant Air. Review their policies before you head to the airport. Checking in at the counter will cost an additional $5 each way. I downloaded the app which worked well for passes and only had a personal item. The prices cannot be beat. I saved $300 over competitors. The flights were on time. Service was bizarre. Flight attendants wore ripped jeans, and were completely disinterested in providing service. Seats are uncomfortable, but I acknowledge I am 6'3 so flying is usually not a joy for me. For the short 1.5 hour flight, it is passable, especially for a fraction of the price of other airlines. Allegiant uses the low cost terminal at LAX, which is terminal 3. No TSA pre-check lane, with long lines. You get what you pay for which is fine. I have booked several more trips with them, because of their cost, but am prepared to be squished.

I called and they switched it with no problem for the cost of the difference of the tickets and did not charge the change fee. Second, we went down to Orlando when Hurricane Matthew hit. We did not want to stay during the hurricane since we have a four year old and a one year old who would have been scared to death. I was afraid for our safety as well. Allegiant switched the flight free of charge. We were able to fly out safe and sound quite literally right before the storm hit. All flights had been canceled after 10. We were supposed to fly out at 7:20, but the pilots had been delayed. We flew out at 11 and thankfully had little turbulence.

Allegiant Air,10,Zachary Zurich,15th October 2016,"Verified Review | Syracuse to Fort Lauderdale with Allegiant Air. After reading the reviews here I was skeptical but given the direct flight and price I decided to take a chance. I was very happy with everything. The weight limit for suitcases was less than other airlines at only 40 pounds and you need to indicate in advance how much checked and carry on items you are bringing and pay for them. Although I paid for carry on I didn't see anyone checking this. You need to print your boarding pass in advance or they charge you $5 at the airport per person. The flight boarded on time and was turned around quickly. They board from the back forward unless you buy priority boarding. I paid for the premium economy seat and it was comfortable. They don't recline but they start out partially reclined so it was comfortable and there was decent room. It was an older plane retrofitted but I was happy with it. I would recommend this airline and I would fly them again. In Europe many of the discount airlines have similar policies so you need to read the fine print and follow their rules but all in all, a good airline, great to fly direct and great price. It's no frills though. No TV, no wifi. But for a short direct flight its worth the trade off. Hopefully they will get wifi on the flights in the future.",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,SYR to FLL,October 2016,4,5,,1,5,5,yes

We had previously printed boarding passes so all we had left to do was go through security prior to boarding. The Flight was actually a little ahead of schedule on that day. Flight attendants were very friendly. We arrived in Las Vegas a few minutes ahead of time, took a cab to hotel. This is where my wife went into panic mode as she could not find her wallet. I contacted the airline, which took 45 minutes before someone actually answered the phone to report a missing wallet. I also contacted the airport as well and filed a report with the Las Vegas police. The wallet contained a substantial amount of money, drivers license and credit card. More than 2 weeks went by with no information on the lost wallet. On October 7th I received a phone call from Allegiant Air headquarters notifying me that the wallet was found. I applaud the flight crew on that particular flight out of Grand Island as the wallet slipped out of my wifes carry-on and one of the flight crew turned it in to lost and found with Allegiant Air.

Dont try to call them ever: I have spent 1h 45 minutes waiting on line without answer. They dont have a toll free number for customer service and when you call their number, it is a loop where I am convinced, no one is at the other end.

I have been flying for over 40 years regularly and this is by far the worst airline I have ever experienced. They have a direct flight from Syracuse to St Petersburg, after the first couple times of 4 to 6 hour delays we thought we'd give it one more try (the only other non-stop is out of Rochester an hour and a half away). We are currently stuck in St Petersburg Clearwater Airport with another six hour delay. Again the reason was mechanical. The weather is perfect throughout the United States today so they could not use that excuse. We are waiting for a plane from somewhere else to take us to Syracuse. They do not even know where the plane is coming from so we cannot check the status. We are 0 for 4 on round trip bookings! That's 8 delays. Not one delay less than 3 hours! We will drive over an hour to Rochester take Southwest Airlines direct flight to Tampa and return Southwest to Rochester and drive over an hour to home.

The only thing we were offered as we waited from 4:20 to 9:30 was some awesome room temperature water and soda. Plus we got an $8 meal voucher.

Allegiant Air,2,Zach Orr,23rd September 2016,"Verified Review | I have flown Allegiant multiple times in the past because they have multiple flights from Sioux Falls, SD (which has limited options of flights as a small city) to large hubs which can get me pretty much anywhere I want to go. Over the last year I have seen a change in the airline and mood of the staff. They have gone from very friendly and customer orientated to more of a second class airline where the customers are treated like cattle. I have felt better about myself and customer service standing at line in McDonalds. They claim they have low rates, but when you actually get through ticket registration they have so many fees they add up to their competitors. I understand they have a bottom line to protect, but I would rather have an airline be upfront and honest with me. For example, I tried to put my personal item (which was a very full backpack, as I had two laptops in there for a business trip) in an overhead bin. I was one of the last ones on the plane and the flight attendant told me I couldn't put it in there as I didn't pay for the storage space and I had to keep it in front of me. Even though there were open spaces and no one else boarding the plane. I will personally never fly this airline again as they are not cheaper than there competitors and they are far less customer orientated than other flights in their price range.",,Business,Economy Class,FSD to LAS,September 2016,2,1,1,,1,2,no

I also recommend Allegiant to family and friends who come to visit as well. I usually pay at least half of what the major airlines charge and that includes my checked baggage. I have only encountered one long delay and that was when I flew to Memphis. We were offered an $8 voucher for a bite to eat and $50 off our next flight. Quite frankly I did not expect that but pleased with the offer. The seats are not plush but are not uncomfortable either and my flights are usually no longer than 2 hours. The seats could use some extra padding but I am thankful they do not recline - it is a definite plus not to have the person in front of you practically lying on your lap. I am happy with paying under $200 for a round trip and $2.00 for a soda instead of getting a free soda and snack and paying over $400 for the ticket. The staff have always been courteous and try to accommodate passengers. My biggest concern is safety and pleased to report every take off and landing has been smooth.

When Allegiant took possession, they took those nice, old style first class seats, along with the rest of the seats, and crammed cheap, flimsy and narrow pieces of plastic where they used to be. Having never flown Allegiant, I was shocked by just how horrible the flight was. Instead of ""if we can make your flight better, let us know,"" the prevailing message was ""our job is to talk down to you,"" as they so politely mentioned how their job was to keep us safe, not comfortable, prior to takeoff, in addition to giving an intercom lecture on alcohol use.

Allegiant Air,1,Larry James,27th August 2016,"Indianapolis to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. I tried this airline for a week trip to Las Vegas. The price was good so why not. Just as I was ready to leave for the airport a message pops up on my phone that the plane was delayed 3 hours. I was still at home so just sat back down and watched TV. Second, on the way to the airport I got another message that the plane is further delayed another hour. Since I was most of the way there I just went on and waited in the airport. Finally the plane arrived and I was boarded for the 3.5 hour flight to Las Vegas. A big guy came to sit next to me. These seats are the smallest seats I have ever seen on an airplane. He spread out over his seat and 1/3 of mine. I thought I will just recline and sleep on the way to Vegas. Wrong, the seats don't recline. They are mostly hard plastic and not well padded (I could feel the supports in my back). This was the 3.5 hour flight from hell. I didn't look forward to getting on that plane at the end of the week to get back home. If you want to pick your seat you have to pay $24 each way for that. And if you have more than a personal item they charge you another $45 for a carry on and even more for a checked bag. There is no free drink service on these flights. They charge you for everything. I booked my rental car though the airline when I was purchasing my ticket and paid for it with the ticket. When I picked up the car at the rental company they also charged me $51 for something with no explanation. I could have waited and bought the rental at Las Vegas for what I paid the airline and this extra charge. never again. So, here I am at the end of the week ready to fly back home. I'm at the airport waiting 10 minutes before the boarding time when they tell everyone that there is a 90 minute delay due to a crew member that isn't there. About 60 minutes into this delay they finally start boarding and after everyone has boarded we sit there and sit there another 40 minutes.

Allegiant Air,5,Robert D Reinhart,24th August 2016,"Missoula to Los Angeles with Allegiant Air. I appreciate low fare airlines to a point. That point was reached on my last round trip with Allegiant Air. The flight was fine. The service was fine. The landing was perfection. The only problem is the seat. The seat was something I've never seen on an airplane until now. It was without any doubt the worst designed, uncomfortable ""seat"" I've ever sat in and I'm not overweight. It consisted of a metal shell wrapped in vinyl with a little over 1 inch of padding. The seat itself was no more than 2 inches thick and it was stationary, i.e. did not recline. Because of the minimal padding and it being a preformed metal shell, the seat did not conform to those ranging in various heights. Someone say 5'7 probably ""fit"" better that someone over 6 feet, etc. The back of the seat had no ""pocket"" to put any of your personal items, like reading glasses or a bottle of water. The arm rest was this tiny little arm about 8 inches in length and an inch in width, essentially a joke. In short, you couldn't design something worse if you tried and there's absolutely no way I could last on a cross country flight being tortured in that seat. You would think seat comfort would still be high on the list when deciding to cut services and charge more for everything (including 5 bucks for a boarding pass) in the airline industry today.

The flight attendants quietly apologized to me and admitted they did not understand the ventilation system on the plane. The apology was quiet, the accusation most defiantly was not. The last three trips have either been delayed by over three hours or cancelled completely. I was informed of the cancelled flight at 1 am. They did not offer a reason or a possible resolution to their error until at least 9 am the next morning. The fix you ask? To fly out 36 hours later. The airline is cheap and has round trips from Grand Rapids to Phoenix with no layovers. That is the only reason I have stayed. That will be my last flight with them.

Allegiant Air,7,Andrea Thomas,10th August 2016,"Las Vegas to Wichita.I was flying with my 18 year old son who has only flown once. We knew the airline has a reputation for being delayed, but it was ok since I didn't have a small child and had the time and patience to wait. The flight from Las Vegas to Wichita was on time and a wonderful flight. On our way from a small town outside of a Wichita (an hour away)when returning to Las Vegas, we didn't know until we got to the airport (2 hours prior as told to do) we found out our flight was delayed 2 hours. That's ok, like I said, we had time to wait. The gate representative told us they had food vouchers for us, which we used. Then they made an announcement that the flight had been canceled due to problems with our plane and they had no other planes to come get us. They offered us a hotel voucher for the night and a shuttle to get us there. All staff was apologetic and understanding, which made it easier to stomach. We knew within an hour when our flight would be going out, which was the next day (a Tuesday when they don't even fly out on Tuesdays) at the same time. We got to the airport and checked our bag and they price our boarding passes since we couldn't access them online. They gave us more.food vouchers, gave us vouchers for another flight discount within the year, remembered me from the day before and moved us along expeditiously AND the costly snacks and beverages on the plane were free to all! I understand things happen and I appreciate them not putting my son and I on a broken plane. But they were gracious and sincere about what a problem this may be to some. But they made up for it with the vouchers and discounts without someone demanding this. I will definitely fly with them again!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to ICT,August 2016,3,4,4,,4,3,yes
Allegiant Air,2,Christine Manning,10th August 2016,"Santa Maria to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Got to the airport around 12:30 pm to get on a flight which was to board at 1:19pm. Plane was put on delay til 4:10pm. Then again, then again. The plane finally showed up around 8 PM. By the time we left it was close to 9pm. Almost 9 hours at the airport. You would think they wouldn't charge for beverages after that on the flight, but they did. They charge for every little thing. Wasted a whole day. I understand occasionally things happen, but from what I understand this is a common thing for Allegiant. Not to mention, the night before our flight going to Santa Maria, not knowing any better I called Allegiant directly to request wheelchairs for my grandparents. After waiting on hold for almost an hour, I was finally connected to someone, who immediately hung up on me before I could utter a word.

Allegiant Air,2,Amber Bowler,9th August 2016,"Springfield to Sanford/Orlando with Allegiant Air. We scheduled a trip right before going back to school for my family and 30 minutes before we left our house for the airport, we got a message our flight had been cancelled. Not delayed, cancelled. With no explanation, we didn't know what was next. So we called Allegiant and waited on the line for 45 minutes. Finally, an unfriendly person answered and said she couldn't tell us if or when the flight would be rescheduled, but that it probably would the next day. Since our trip was already a quick one, that cut it down another day (without even being sure about when we would leave), so we opted for the refund. 9 days later and we still have not received our refund. Tried calling again to ask about the refund and waited on the line 30 minutes and gave up. Their communication is horrible. It is also frustrating because it left us with no time to schedule another trip. They gave us $100 vouchers to fly again, but no viable options to use them before summer break ends. Vouchers will probably go to waste because I'm not sure I want to depend on them again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SGF to SFB,July 2016,1,1,,,1,1,no

I brought with me her birth certificate, social security card, and a written letter from her parents so that she could board the plane. We went to Allegiants front desk at the Sanford airport and they checked us in, only asking for my ID and no further questions. Next we went through security where they only checked my ID. So I have an unidentified child with me. Not to mention the repeated 5hr delays. I will never recommend this airline. I guess you get what you pay for which isn't much.

Total lack of communication between everyone and we had similar problems to Vegas. We were lucky compared to others who had to cancel other bookings. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money on a reliable airline and save yourself all the stress.

Allegiant Air,5,Beth Bellen,7th August 2016,"Verified Review | We are getting ready to board a flight from Sanford, Florida to Bloomington, IL. We checked in last night & were assigned row 23 with all 3 family members together. When we got to the check-in we noticed that we got bumped back to rows 28 & 29. We mentioned something to the guy at the counter & he said they needed to downgrade us on the plane so all seats got switched around. I mentioned I really hate being in the back of the plane & he let me know it wasnt the back. I mentioned it was three rows from it & (again empathy at its best) well its not the back. He also said we are all still together which we are not. I have a fear of enclosed spaces & being towards the back of the plane. 5 or so rows might not seem like a lot to a ticket agent or being in separate rows but they could at least have a bit more empathy & customer service. Why have early check-in if you are going to move us around anyways?! Not impressed with Allegiant Air at all. As I am writing this post my husband went to talk with the agent at the gate & she was fabulous. We are not all together but I have a seat in row 6 now.

Allegiant Air,8,Sheila Buie,6th August 2016,"Jacksonville to Memphis. I was a little nervous after some of the reviews, but my first experience with Allegiant wasn't bad. Tickets were inexpensive. Allegiant is for those who want to simply get from Point A to Point B for the best price. Our check in bag weighed less than 40 pounds so we did not have to pay extra for that. We printed our boarding passes at home so we did not have to pay the fee to print them there. We had 2 backpacks we took on that we kept under our seats and checked in our one suitcase. Seats were comfortable to me. On flight food and drink - yeah you have to pay and originally we didn't plan on it, but $2.00 for a soda was perfectly reasonable and the Kids Snack Pack was $5.00 and it came with a pin. My son loved it. As much as we saved with the flight ticket prices, 9 bucks for 2 sodas and a kids meal pack wasn't bad at all. Check in attendants, pilot and flight attendants were friendly.

Allegiant Air,1,H Scott,4th August 2016,"Allegiant Air from Springfield to Sanford return. Our flight to Florida was fine. Our flight back to Missouri never happened. Flight was scheduled to leave at 9:00 AM. We were at Disney and had a car service picking us up at 5:30 AM. At 2:30 AM we receive a text from Allegiant saying our flight has been cancelled and to call customer service. No other information is given. So, it is 2:30 AM we scramble to cancel our car service which we got charged for. We are at Disney and it is not like you can just stay an extra night. We called 4 times on hold for over 30 minutes each time and never could talk to someone. We had no idea when or if another flight would be scheduled so we ended up booking a flight home with another airline. It was not until 4:00 PM the following day we received an email stating our new flight would be departing at 7:30 pm. They literally gave us 3 hours notice, but never sent boarding passes. Luckily we were already home by now. I finally spoke to customer service at 6:00 pm to notify them we would not be needed our seats and see if I could get a refund. They did not even have us scheduled on the flight! So, we would have gotten to the airport expecting to get a flight home, but nothing. They did refund our fee for our trip back, but nothing else.

Allegiant Air,1,S Lewis,2nd August 2016,"Elmira to Orlando. We fly back and forth from Florida to NY several times a year and have learned our lesson the hard way. Forget the money you save, if any. They advertise better prices, but by time you select seats and pay for any and all luggage, you aren't saving anything. Even with ""Trip Flex"" (for an extra $75) for insurance on your flight they will not reimburse your lost expenses even if they cancel the flight. As in previous reviews, cancelations by them are due to ""crew or mechanical"" issues. They offer vouches for future flights, but forget any money back on the trip you have planned now and they limit he time you have to use it, so hope you have lots of vacation time. You also get no reimbursement if you need to change your flight, even within their guidelines, again you get vouchers for money off a future flight. Forget getting ahold of anyone at the call center, minimum wait times on hold are 30 minutes and I've sat on hold for over an hour, about a flight they canceled only to have the call ended...and call back in and wait again. You will also be treated with a an ""oh well, we don't care"" attitude that they have messed up your plans or trip. They've already got your money, and obviously do not care about customer service. We booked over a dozen flights last year between Florida and NY. 3 with Allegiant and the rest another airline. Two of our flights with Allegiant had issues, with them cancelling. One of our flights with another airline had issues due to weather. The more reputable airline bent over backwards to get us on a flight with another airline to make our destination , late but at least the same day, they also negotiated for us to get a decent rate on the last minute flight, actually saving us money, and refunded our money for the complete flight booked with them even though we used the return portion!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ELM to MCO,August 2016,1,1,,,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,H Stoben,1st August 2016,"Verified Review | Their motto should be ""our fares are cheap so we don't care if you enjoy the flight"". This was my first and last experience with Allegiant Air. I booked a one way reservation departing Pittsburgh and arriving at Punta Gorda, scheduled take off at 2:11pm. The online check in advertised as ""skip the lines"" is a joke because you still have to check your luggage at the ticket counter - where two people are staffed to assist a line of 100+ passengers. At 1:15, passengers who had the mobile app received text messages stating that the flight was delayed until 4:40. Passengers who did not have the app were confused because the screens at the gate and the mobile app itself did not reflect the delay. There was no Allegiant Air representative at the gate to provide clarification, so after 2:11 came and went, it was obvious that the delay was legit. At 3:30, an Allegiant air rep arrived at the gate and announced that our plane was due to land at 4:30, and that everybody needed to hurry up and board the plane after the passengers were released. At 4:00 the Allegiant attendant announced for everyone to ""be quiet and listen up"" because the plane was going to be a little later because of ""storms"" - and suggested that we look at weather radar to confirm the weather patterns. The plane landed at 5:00, and we were told that they needed to clean the plane before boarding. At 5:20 they started boarding special needs and priority passengers and told every one else not to get in line until their zone was called. Once they called for zone two, where people had already started lining up, an attendant again reminded us to ""be quiet and listen up"" and then said that we needed to hurry up and start boarding or else the flight would be canceled(?). They also told passengers for the flight to Orlando that was currently posted at our gate, that they needed to go to an alternate gate. A few of us brought it to representatives attention that the posted flight and time for Orlando on the screens were showing that it was departing from our gate, we were told that they didn't have anyone to change the information - so of course people who arrived at the gate after the announcement boarded the plane (oddly, not discovered at the gate by the attendants), and further delayed our take off as they were removed after everyone else was seated. Then at 5:45, the captain apologized for the delay, citing that they had some mechanical problems in Myrtle Beach (weren't the delays caused by ""storms""? The Allegiant rep even emphasized that we validate the presence of storms on the radar, guess that was a little white lie). Then the captain started yapping something about the fact that if we weren't airborne in exactly 15 minutes, the legal flight hours for the pilots would be exceeded and they would have to cancel the flight. We literally lifted off with one minute to spare, and the cabin actually erupted with passengers clapping and saying how bad this airline was.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,PI to PGD,July 2016,1,1,,,1,1,no

I spent time reading many Allegiant reviews just before boarding, and I can say the negative reviews were unfounded. I boarded the plane, flew to my destination and disembarked. It met my minimal expectations, I got that for which I paid. Job well done. The flight was delayed 30-45 mins but I was informed of that before I left my house.

Flight from Kalispell was actually a charter plane (Sun Country) as Allegiant had no planes available. This meant no beverage or snack service was available on the flight.

I do hate the nickle and dime attitude of the airline (paying for carry on luggage, paying to print a boarding pass etc) but they got me where I was going at the time promised.

Allegiant Air,1,J Greco,30th July 2016,Verified Review | Our last 2 flights from Sioux Falls to Las Vegas have been canceled. The first time they told us there was no crew and the 2nd the excuse was mechanical issues. In both situations we couldn't leave until the following day. We were given $100 vouchers which sort of traps you into feeling like need to book with them again to use it but it's not worth it. As already mentioned in several reviews the cost incurred from their totally unreliable service generally exceeds the money you think you are saving when you buy their tickets--even with the $100 voucher. We're out over $600 between our hotel room and show tickets for a show we can't attend now because our rescheduled flight the day after we were supposed to leave doesn't take off until 6pm--if it actually ends up leaving at all. It seems to be a real crap shoot. In talking with others at the airport nearly everyone had stories of being burned by flight cancellations. Allegiant has no concern for the fact they are destroying vacation plans that in most cases people have been looking forward to for months. Bottom line is that Allegiant is a horrible airline that sells you tickets for services they can't provide.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FSD to LAS,July 2016,1,2,,,1,2,no

Allegiant Air,1,Deborah Byrd,28th July 2016,"Las Vegas to Reno. I am actually unsure of where to start. This was the biggest nightmare ever. I showed up for my flight two hours early. When I got my gate there were upset people everywhere. There were two flights that had been there all day waiting for their plane to board and leave. I was flying to meet my husband in Reno. Our plane was supposed to take of at 6:15. It was 7pm and we hadn't even heard anything yet. When they finally told us something they said our plane was still in Great Falls and should be there in two hours. They gave us all meal vouchers for 8 dollars - everything was closed and seriously 8 dollars? So we waited two hours where they then announced ""The plane still hasn't left due to mechanical issues, we are working very hard to have another plane to get everyone taken care of, please be patient. We have a plan - we just don't know what the plan is yet"". We literally all started laughing. This went on for hours. They would not give us a straight answer on anything. They kept us all there until midnight where they then canceled the flight and said it would fly out the next day but didn't know which time. Also they had already put all our luggage on a broken down plane (why?) so we all had to wait another hour and half to get our check ins off. They offered everyone 300 dollars for a room. No rooms were available at midnight Friday night in Las Vegas. So over 20 people spent the night at the airport. If you live within 60 miles of the airport they don't reimburse you for the hotel and they pay your hotel within 6 months.

At 2:00 am on the day of our scheduled departure I received a TXT from Allegiant that our flight for that day as well as our return flight a week later had been cancelled. Checked the website sure enough flight says cancelled. No other information, just cancelled. And they only fly on Mondays and Fridays from TYS to LAS so it's not like we have any alternatives. So immediately I begin to think about all of the other reservations I needed to cancel before I get charged for not showing up. 1st night hotel is prepaid non-refundable: $200 lost, next 2 nights at Zion Lodge already past the cancellation deadline by 1 day - $500 lost, La Jolla I lose the first night deposit $300 lost, luckily can cancel by last night at airport.

Allegiant Air,2,A Scherff,26th July 2016,"Horrible first time experience. Our flight from Las Vegas to Sioux Falls, SD was first delayed Sunday, July 24. We were told that we were waiting on the captain. Then they didn't know where he was. After sitting on the plane for 45 min, we all had to exit because the internal temperature of the plane had risen too much and was not safe, supposedly due to all of the bodies on board. Once off the plane, there were rumors it could take 2 hours or more, or possibly not even until the morning, before we were able to leave. Then it was announced it would take 20 minutes to half hour and it should be cooled off enough for us to safely board. After an hour, we were told we could board again. Once we were on and all seated, they told us 1) Some people didn't come back on, so they had to reevaluate for weight, and 2) There wasn't enough fuel to get us to South Dakota, so we had to go to Mesa, Arizona to fuel up. Once in the air, a loud, piercing shrill started up. Damage your ears loud and high pitched. The entire hour to Mesa, AZ. They announced over the loudspeaker that they knew about the noise and would be looking into it once we landed. Once we started descending, the noise stopped. When we landed, they started handing out small cups of complimentary ice water. We asked if we needed to worry about the internal temperature rising again while we waited, since that was the problem in Vegas. We were told by a stewardess that we ""weren't being held hostage, that we could get off at any time, but they couldn't make any promises that we would be able to get back on."" After a little while, we noticed people taking our baggage off the plane and tossing it onto carts. Turns out we were going to be boarding a different plane anyway, they needed to take ours for a test run to find out the cause of the problem. When we got into the small airport at Mesa, AZ, their little shop with snacks wasn't open. We just assumed it was so they could charge us $3 for M&M's or $5 for a Snack Pack on the flight. Moral of the story, folks, if you want to feel just a little safer while flying and have flight attendants that aren't so rude, don't fly Allegiant. Save up, spend that extra money on a good airline.

One thing I can tell you is that I have a friend that did experience a delay from Kansas City to FL but she was given vouchers for a hotel stay and food. So maybe they are improving in that regard (not sure). I will surely fly again. Unbeatable price, great seating, great staff, great pilot, great trip!

I tried to make the best of the situation and accepted I was staying in LA one more day. Luckily, I was staying with family, so I didn't spend extra $$ on transportation and lodging. The following day, we boarded the rescheduled flight and ended up getting delayed for almost 2 hours, while we were inside the plane! They had 24 hours to fix the mechanical issues and yet continued to be bombarded with more! The poor flight attendant ended up having to do her ""fasten seatbelt"" shpiel at least 3 times before the plane was fixed and the door was closed.

Allegiant Air,3,Kimberly Huff,24th July 2016,"We spent our 16 wedding anniversary in Las Vegas airport. Being the responsible adults that we are, we arrived 2 hours early for our 2:15 flight from Vegas to Tulsa. Our flight was delayed at least 4 times (I lost count). We were told that the delays were due to a non-functioning external a/c unit that was supposed to keep the plane cool in-between flights. They told us that it ran for at least an hour before anyone noticed the problem. The plane was sitting in Vegas sunlight in 114 degree weather without a/c. In addition to the delays, we experienced 1 aborted take off (plane had physically left the ground, but pilot had to abort and take us back due to an air speed sensor malfunction) after having set on the tarmac for 1.5 hours without a/c. A second boarding during which we set on the tarmac for 2 hours without a/c. While we were sitting in a sweltering plane some of the passengers voiced their frustration. The pilot then got on the speaker and threatened all passengers with an air marshal if we did not keep our opinions to ourselves. This was after he told us all via the speaker that this was ""just one of those nights."" We started down the runway this time and never even got to attempt take off due to one of the blinds reportedly coming off a window. We were deplaned a 2nd time and told that our flight was cancelled. The staff waiting at the gate informed us at that point that we passengers should begin looking for our own hotel accommodations. They would not assist us in any fashion. Allegiant Air would reimburse us up to $300 for the hotel, and will reportedly reimburse us for transportation to/from the airport. They estimated that we would get out reimbursement in 5-7 days. Keep in mind that this is Vegas, on a weekend and it was now after 11 p.m. We couldn't find a room under $300, so we are now losing $$ through no fault of our own. I also had to cancel our reservation in Tulsa, which was now outside of the ""no penalty/no charge"" window. I spent a lot of time pleading my case not to be charged for a room that we would now be unable to use. For our troubles, we were given $8 meal vouchers and a $100 credit towards future Allegiant Air flights?! $8 doesn't buy a meal at Vegas airport. And we will not be flying with that airline again - that credit is useless. We understand that things happen, but the nonchalant and at times downright rude attitude of their staff just put an even more bitter taste in my mouth.

As soon as we reached the terminal, we were informed of an hour delay. No big deal, we could wait. Apparently there was ""aircraft maintenance"" and some planes had to be switched around. Of course, as someone who travels frequently, this is understandable. What's not understandable is how we went through 3 delays, until they finally told us a final departure time at 1:45am. The airline brought in pizza and refreshments, just to settle us down. Then, at midnight, an announcement was made by a very snarky associate who informed us that the flight was completely cancelled. This made us lose 300$ car rental and hotel reservations. So, since the pilots were ""timed out"" they told us to get a hotel if we were more than 15 miles away, because they did not have a certain time for us to come back the next day and said they ""would email us"". We were sprawled around the airport at this time, some of us sleeping, and we came to the counter to ask questions. We still don't know when our flight will happen. We would normally cancel, but this trip is necessary to see family.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TUL to LAX,July 2016,,,,,1,1,no

We fly frequently between Las Vegas and Iowa, and are disappointed nearly every time we fly Allegiant. In fact, we are surprised when things actually go smoothly and on-time. We continued to choose them because of their direct flights to smaller Iowa locations, hoping that the service would improve. But when we have to book hotels or postpone plans because of cancelled and delayed flights, that benefit no longer outweighs the negatives. If this had only happened once or twice, I wouldn't bother reviewing this.

Also I couldn't not fight a flight to get back home not until Thursday or Friday, because flights were all booked. We both already missed a day of work, so I had to book with Allegiant again to fly somewhere else to get me closer to home. So I booked flights to Harrisburg.Pa then rented a car to drive to Niagara airport to get my car that was parked there. Then finally we had to drop renter car in Buffalo Airport and was able to head home afterwards. This was such a stressful experience. I needed to get back home to my kids and work.

We had checked in online the day before, thinking we'd just quickly print boarding passes at airport, like you can with basically any other airline. Not so with Allegiant. You have to stand in line forever and pay $5 just to get it. Then our delayed boarding time comes and goes with still no plane and no info provided to us about what's going on. Many people there were there from a cancelled flight the day before. Luckily a plane did finally come after a 4 hour delay. They had overbooked it and so some that thought they had seats didn't.

I endured a 2 day weekend of nothing but delays and an eventual cancellation of flight due to mechanical issues. This wouldn’t have been so bad if I was traveling by myself, but I had a handful of kids in-tow. What good does it do to buy cheap airfare tickets if the airline cannot get one to the destination on time or even in a timely manner? This 2 day delay had a devastating ripple effect throughout my entire 7 day itinerary. It seems that this company can’t keep track of its own pilots. Allegiant flew a different plane in to DSM only to find out that the pilots were out of air time. Here is a working airplane, but no one to fly it. What kills me is that the company is military strict on checked baggage weight, but it asks flyers to open the air vents and click the seatbelts before deplaning. I have strict flying rules too. Make me unload 3 lbs. from my checked luggage into my personal carry-on at the check-in stand (on a return trip no less) and you can click your own seatbelts and close window shades behind me.",DC80,Family Leisure,Economy Class,DSM to PIE,July 2016,1,3,,,2,1,no

No big deal except when we arrived and went through security at 7am we were told by airport staff Allegiant mechanics had not shown up and our flight crew were nowhere to be found so again we were delayed another 3 hours.

So fast forwarding to 8/10 our 8.20 return flight. We get to the airport to find out all computers are down, luckily I checked in online. So for starters we expected a small delay. So at about 8.35 we get to board to then sit on the plane until 10.15 before they make everyone get off the plane. Again no accommodations. We finally board and leave at 11.20 - another 3 hour delay.

We booked this flight because it was cheap and not a true ""red eye"". The seats on the plane were extremely uncomfortable and did not recline even though we paid extra for the seats with extra leg room. The first leg of the trip the extra leg room seats had maybe an extra 6 inches of room. The return flight extra leg room seats had much more leg room but the seats were still very uncomfortable and didn't recline. I would have been okay with the seats on a short flight, but this was a 6 hour flight. We could not sleep at all in these uncomfortable seats. The return flight back from Honolulu was also over an hour late taking off. Also on the return flight, we had to wait an hour for our luggage at the carousel.

American Airlines increased their rates for summer travel, so I have opted to fly Allegiant to be more cost effective. My flight from Concord to St Pete was delayed. 3.5 hours. Making my arrival at 1.00 am. Because Allegiant does not fly from Concord to Punta Gorda this left me with a 3 hour drive to Southwest Florida or I should say my husband with a six hours drive round trip to pick me up. The flight returning to Concord from St. Pete was delayed again. The 6.15 was delayed until 8.00. At least that's what they are saying at the moment since I'm writing this in real time. No updates were given until 1 hour post our boarding time and they were minimal. A beautiful plane sits on the tarmac with no passengers to board. This should have been our ticket home but the plane was overbooked for the flight because the am flight was cancelled without notice. Or there could be mechanical issues who know because they don't up date you on anything.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CON to PIE,June 2016,1,1,1,,1,1,no

Our return flight was cancelled with no notice. They didn't offer a return flight, nor any compensation to book a flight through another airline. Was on hold for 3 hours.

Today I was to fly home at 7:30 am, we got a call 2 hours before saying the flight will be delayed 3 hours (10:30 am). This means paying double transportation because you have to change your time to be picked up. Then we get to the gate and they say our flight is cancelled because there's not enough room for everyone. This means we paid transportation for nothing and we left our hotel when we could've stayed there another night instead of dealing with the hassle. The airline knew that the flight would be canceled the whole time. Now our flight is reassigned to tomororw at 3:45 pm. We did get a room voucher.

No counter service and non-existent phone service. My family scheduled a quick weekend in Orlando and decided to try Allegiant Air (from Fargo) for the first time due to price, and the convenience of the direct flight. I received a text that the flight was cancelled just as we arrived at the Fargo airport. Mind you, they would have known the flight was cancelled long before that because their only in-bound flight would have been coming from Orlando. No reason was offered and we were given a non-toll free number to call where we sat on hold for a half-hour before being disconnected, then tried again and sat on hold for over an hour before we got to talk to somebody. We opted for the refund and purchased a last-minute, expensive ticket on another airline because we did not have calendar flexibility. Turns out that the return Allegiant flight was also cancelled.

As I arrived at the border, I received a text saying it was delayed until 9pm. Well after more than one delay, we landed in Vegas just after 3am. The delay, it seemed was due to mechanical issues. While it inconvenienced both myself and the person picking me up in Vegas, I would rather have a safe plane than attempt to be on time with a malfunctioning place. And this is not the first time I have had a delay (with other airlines). They emailed out $50 vouchers to the passengers (I haven't had an airline do that before). It's a nuisance that they charge for on board luggage, seat selection, even water, but the other airlines charge for some of those things too. They don't provide the same prices tho. The website is easy to use, and so far, of the flights I took or my friend in Vegas has taken to come up to Bellingham, this is the first incident with Allegiant.

To start off we signed up for flight alerts and when we had arrived to the airport 2 hours before our flight we found out it was cancelled. We ended up spending 2 hours waiting in line (as well as on hold on the phone). By the time we got to the front of the queue we were told that there would be a flight for use the next day. We tried to reroute and work through it but customer service was impossible to work with and ended up just writing our name down. They promised they would look into it and call me when they had more information. They never called me. I also sent an email to their support, and it's been 3 days and I haven't heard anything back. In any case, the next day we show up to our flight and they did not reassign the seats, so everyone sat anywhere they wanted which displeased many passengers - myself included.

Allegiant Air,2,Andrew Hartle,3rd June 2016,"Verified Review | I flew from Phoenix/Mesa Gateway airport, which is more convenient to my house to Ft Wayne, IN,. The seat was fairly uncomfortable for me, it is the newer style of carbon fiber frame and had very thin seat padding. These seats don’t recline at all, the tray tables are smaller than they used to be and you can’t put anything in the seat back other than papers. You used to be able to put a water bottle or other items in the seat pocket, but no more. This airline charges you for everything, so I’m not sure you are really saving much money on Allegiant. Refreshments cost a minimum of $2 for a can of pop. I normally barely pay that for a 12 pack of pop. Their schedule to Ft Wayne is very limited, making it harder to schedule your stay. And they don’t even fly to Ft Wayne at ALL from 8/13 to 11/15. Either you are providing service to the city or not. When the pilots gave announcements, we could not hear what he was saying because he talked so softly. I asked the people sitting in my row if they heard what he said, and they could not hear him either. On the return flight, the cabin temperature became very warm inside. I did ask the flight attendant if she could lower the temp, and apparently she did because it became slightly cooler in the cabin. Also on the return flight, after a short while the pilot turned on the seat belt sign and kept it on the entire way back. There were a few bumpy periods during this time, but not the whole way back. He could have turned it off for some of the time so people could move around a bit. I became very antsy in my seat after about 90-120 min of flight. At least the flight did leave very close to on time and arrived on time.

Allegiant Air,3,Megan Steele,22nd May 2016,"I've been flying with Allegiant Air for the past couple years. My boyfriend lives in Florida and I live in Ohio, so the price that Allegiant offers is very competitive compared to other airlines. I've never been thrilled by my flights with Allegiant (inconvenient times, not a lot of flexibility, fees for bags and reservation changes that add up), but it does have its perks (affordable, small airlines so less security hassle, nonstop flights). However, the past couple of flights we have experienced multiple delays. It seems almost as if this is becoming a signature of Allegiant flights. This past flight was already inconveniently timed to fly out at 8pm and arrive at 10pm (this would be fine if there was a choice, but this was the only time available from LCK). That afternoon, the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. Annoying, but no big deal (I should mention that the airport is an hour away from my final destination, so each delay made the drive to Sarasota more and more inconvenient). Once I was at the airport (arrived early at 5:30, figured I could work on homework or read), I received a text message that the flight was delayed until 9:16pm (there was not an announcement at the airport for a while - only text messages at first). Around 9pm, we received another missive that informed us that the flight would leave at 10:56pm. The workers at the airport were not at the gate for most of this, maybe avoiding angry passengers? There were sporadic announcements to the gates. Long story short, we left at 11:30pm and arrived around 1:30am; I arrived in Sarasota around 2:45am, almost 4 hours later than I had planned. Allegiant never explained to us the reason for such a drastic delay (only made worse by the lateness of the original flight). Was it weather? The flight was flying out of Myrtle Beach and into Ohio. Was it computer issues (they seem to encounter these a lot - which only freaks me out more about the safety of the flights)? Something else? The pilot and flight attendants were all very kind on the flight, and all of the passengers were pretty complacent (no annoying irate passengers to deal with - which I appreciated). However, an explanation would have been nice. Maybe even some free food on the flight to make up for the 3 hour delay! I'm not sure if I'll be flying Allegiant again. Probably I will, because I can't afford to fly anyone else. While there are some good things about Allegiant, I still have many major issues with them. I realize that they are a discount airline and therefore the fees and inconvenient times are necessary. But please be upfront about the reason about delays, and maybe consider a way to make it up to your passengers.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LCK to PGD,May 2016,3,3,1,,2,3,no
Allegiant Air,1,Casey Nealy,21st May 2016,"Greensboro to Sanford with Allegiant Air. Our flight to Orlando was delayed 4 hours. We ended up missing our Carnival cruise leaving from Port Canaveral. When we decided to try to find plane tickets to the Bahamas to meet the ship there, Allegiant offered no help whatsoever. Carnival advised us to get a letter from Allegiant explaining that there were mechanical issues that caused the delay. We talked to several Allegiant staff and no one could print us a letter. Staff acted like they had no clue what we were talking about. We eventually resulted to asking them if they could at least print us some boarding passes with the correct time that we left so we could prove our flight was delayed but they would not do this either. Customer service was not great. In Greensboro, the woman acted like we were inconviencing her when we asked for help. Also, two staff members were cussing and joking around while we were trying to check in our bags. At Sanford, the woman at the desk kept helping other people behind us in line. Overall the professionalism of the company is horrible. I understand that issues and delays happen but the fact that no help was given is unacceptable. The staff kept brushing us off. The staff from American Airlines helped us find tickets to the Bahamas and cared more about our situation and we didn't even fly with them.

No you don't get the 4oz of soda, coffee or tea for free when flying with them, but you do save $75 to $100 by not getting that beverage. On April 9th I flew in from Florida to New Hampshire after a 10 day vacation. When I landed in Portsmouth I went right to the baggage claim area to get my luggage. I waited and waited and waited. All the luggage is gone and there are two of us standing there without ours. One of Allegiant employees was there and asked if we got our luggage. Both of us said NO. Employee called someone and said then we were told that one had fallen off the belt and it would be right up. It was the other persons not mine. After waiting a hour or so for employees to search, I was told it was no where is that airport. The employee took me to the counter and started a claim. She was very nice and I was told that I would have it FedEx to me. She said I would probably see it Monday. Well Monday came and went. The next Monday came and went. After 10 days and no news I started writing and calling. I was told they are doing everything they could and would let me know. A week later after not hearing anything I reached out again and asked if they checked Fort Lauderdale or NY. I said NY because when I was checking in my bag the counter person asked if I was going to NY. I said NH! Since that last conversation with Allegiant, I have not heard back from them. They are now ignoring my emails and phone calls. My last message left to them was asking if Luggage falls from plans, but we never hear of it. Still Waiting!!

Allegiant Air,1,J Butler,17th May 2016,"We booked an Allegiant Air flight well in advance from Punta Gorda, FL, to Asheville, NC on May 6 to return on May 16. This trip was planned based on children’s recitals, friends’ travel plans, graduation date, and the Allegiant Airlines limited schedule. On the morning of May 6, our travel day, I received a text message, saying that our flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. When I called Allegiant, the agent would give no reason for the change. The weather in Asheville, Punta Gorda and between was beautiful; most of the east coast was also nice. I believe that the flight was cancelled because there were not enough seats sold. The fact that the flight was rescheduled for the next day would foul our tight schedule that involved driving to several other locations before returning to Asheville. Besides, what would motivate us to trust that Allegiant would fly on the 7th if they weren’t flying on the 6th? They refunded my fare and car rental charges, the minimum they could do and the most that they would do. The result is that two arthritic seniors drove an extra 1400 miles and an extra 24 hours. We put 2700 miles on our car, instead of zero with the rental. This is our third attempted trip on Allegiant, with only one that went as scheduled.

These include cancelled flights, poor counter service and rudeness from the counter staff in Idaho Falls, and long delays of flights. This is a review of the customer service quality of the counter personnel at McCarran airport. First off, there is very limited times the counter is open, 3 days a week, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. I arrived at 10:45 and waited for 15 minutes for the woman at the counter to check in 1 person, who was already at the counter when I arrived. This spot at the counter was the only one that did not say ""check in"" or ""bag drop"", but only said ""Allegiant Air"". It was apparently was the priority check in line since when I approached the counter I was asked if I was priority check in. I replied no and was informed I had to wait in the long line. I explained I was not checking in, but was there to purchase tickets. She looked at the clock and it was 11:00, so she informed me that she would not sell me a ticket because it was 11:00. NOT EVEN 11:01 Are you kidding me? I wait in line while she takes her sweet time with 1 person and then won't sell me tickets because I am now too late? I guess they don't really need my business after all. If you have a viable alternative, save yourself the hassle, inconvenience, rude employees, delayed and cancelled flights, and hidden fees etc.that nickel and dime you to death so you end up paying almost the same as elsewhere, and use the alternative.

This is the 2nd time I've flown Allegiant. I made my reservations with Allegiant because 1) It was half the price of the major airlines and 2) It was a direct flight from Springfield, Mo to Las Vegas. I paid extra for priority seating and carrying my bag on the plane. I printed my boarding pass off at home and then downloaded the app so I had it in my phone as well. This way I never had to deal with the counter. I always have snacks on me so the fact that you had to pay for Snacks/drinks (water too) didn't bother me. I also didn't think the seats were uncomfortable or there was a leg room issue. If you fly a lot most planes these days have decreased their legroom so for 3 hours it wasn't a big deal. My only ""complaint"" is that departure time seems to be a suggestion. We left about 45 minutes late. The boarding process was slow so be prepared for that. I would suggest paying the $15ish fee and get priority boarding and a seat at the front of the plane. I thought the staff were friendly and I would fly them again.

We have flown Allegiant Airlines several times, but twice in the last month both flights were delayed and then cancelled until the next day with no explanation - weather was not an issue. Many others in line with us after the cancellation said they had several flights with Allegiant cancelled and had to stay overnight as well. Both times the flight was cancelled we stood in line for over an hour to receive a $100 voucher for a future flight. Allegiant has no extra planes to send in so you just have to stay overnight and since our flight was supposed to be at 7.15 am that means hanging out at the hotel all day unless you want to pay to rent a car. Allegiant counter staff were fairly rude and matter of fact - the man behind us had a wife graduating from college that night and was going to have to miss it. Transportation to the airport was disorganized and you had to have a receipt and send it in to get reimbursed. I don't ever post reviews but want to warn others that the discount prices of this airline aren't worth it.",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,TUL to MCO,May 2016,2,1,,,1,1,no

About 1/2 hour before we left our entire flight was cancelled and we were told the flight crew did not show up. They rescheduled the flight for the next day. Most people can not do this as they have limited vacation time and I had to work the next day. All we got was a refund for our flight (which I am still waiting for) and a huge hassle in trying to find another flight to get home. Do they not have backup flight attendants? We should have received a full refund of our flight and money for our time. It cost me money and time, and an exhausting all day trip home, because I had to then go to a different airline, and travel out of the way just to get home.

I was told it was a mechanical problem then 11pm I was told the captain had exceeded his working hours. It was unbelievable. At 9pm we were offered soda. At 10pm we were offered an $8 dollar food voucher. This was ridiculous because $8 couldn't even cover the cost for sandwich, the voucher so late in the night that food in the fridge was gone. We had to get out of the terminal the only shop that was open a bagel shop and then we had to re-check in with security to come back in. The bagel shop the cashier yelled at us and refused to take the voucher until someone called an Allegiant Air personnel to talk to them. At 11:00pm they finally told use flight was cancelled they would book hotel accommodations. There are over 100 people on this flight so by the time we got our hotel accommodation we were booked the worker said they ""would call the bus"" to come pick us up from the airport to the hotel. Which took another 45 minutes to get us to the hotel by the time we got to hotel it was pass midnight. we were schulded to fly out next day at 10am. I was going to be very smart and beat the crowd and to get my tickets for this flight. I arrived at 6am. Only to find out that the ticket counter didn't open until two hours before the flight. So how the heck were they supposed to check in about 100 passengers onto this flight most people needed tickets printed luggage checked in and be ready by 10 o'clock for take off. I was second in line and flight didn't get started for check in until 8:15am. the captain is sitting at the boarding desk. He is also highly irritated himself trying to explain to us that he was too tired that he had worked his Max hours and could not fly the night before. how the heck is that my problem - 10 am rolls around and no one to help with boarding. I had paid for seats towards the front in row 10 bc of medical issues, but as my medical issues were not life ""threatening"" they told me I had to wait until Zone 5 was called - by the time my zone was called I had to sit in the back of the plane.

About an hour and a half sitting at the airport I received another alert - flight delayed until 10:10pm. The plane was having issues. I'm all about a safe plane and was fine with it. Once finally boarded at 11:00 we were asked to get off of the plane apparently because we had been drinking.

We arrived, parked, got through TSA and immediately received a 3rd text that the flight would be delayed after all. SO we had no dinner, Owensboro Airport has no where to buy food or drinks, so we sat forever waiting, waiting. Then Allegiant decided to delay the flight again via overhead announcement. We arrived in Orlando about midnight finally and got to the hotel at 2.00am. None of this above is taking into account our 79.00 one way fare (which ended up totalling $525.00) for the two of us.

Sent a letter to customer service to verify what was said to me on the phone call concerning Nut allergies and seating children with parents. Was told by a travel representation that nut allergies are taken very seriously and children are never separated from a parent. Boarded our flight, the flight attendants that day denied alerting the passengers of my 9 year olds nut allergy. Said that have him deal with it and place him by the window. Into the flight they began selling snacks containing Peanuts and Tree Nuts. My son became ill, administered more antihistamines and received zero assistance from the flight crew. There was a nurse onboard who came to our aide. Hindsight is 20/20 I wish I would have read the airline reviews before purchasing our seats. Please take the time to read the Allegiant customer comments on how horribly they treat their customers.

Allegiant delayed the flight twice and left at least two passengers I'm aware of at security because no one was at the check in desk for them to get boarding passes. I barely made it on the flight despite that issue only because I had my boarding pass downloaded on the app already. No one was there to check my bag and they refused to send anyone out to the desk to help those two people, one of which came right after me. Allegiant has a reputation for being late, yet they wouldn't help passengers who were a measly 5 min late after they'd delayed the flight twice by 3 hours.

It is a budget airline that uses business tactics different than the major carriers to stay profitable. That means, older aircraft, younger crews, and gotcha games. If you can accept that and live with some minor first-world inconveniences, the cheap tickets are well worth it, especially for families like ours. Our flights were on time and comfortable. The crew wasn't overly friendly, but professional nonetheless. My only complaint is their iPhone App for boarding tickets.

Allegiant Air,1,D Roger,26th March 2016,"We tried Allegiant Air because it offers the only non-stop service between PIT and JAX. And that is the full extent of what this airline has to offer. At best, Allegiant Air's service is comical, but functional - at worst, it's non-existent. Customer service is like a pick-up team of airline personnel from ticketing to flight crew. Check-in lines are long because the counter is only open for one hour prior to flight, so everyone is forced to queue at once. Both flights were delayed (one hour and two hours, respectively) for no apparent reason. In the aircraft cabin, the seats are set close together yet the aisle is very wide. The high bag check fees ensure that boarding will be very slow. Promotion doesn't seem to be part of the corporate marketing strategy. There are practically no signs anywhere - at ticket/check-in counter or gates. Pricing is not especially competitive on this route once the add-ons for bag checks and better seats are included.

Allegiant has been on time and the check in / boarding pass system works well. If you are travelling with kids the online check in will not allow you to check in if you did not pre select your seats for a fee.

I was not pleased with this and emailed the note we got from the Allegiant staff at the airport where it says 250 each. After that we're told not to contact Allegiant again.

We booked a flight and hotel originally through Allegiant only to receive a text informing me that the confirmation number I had received would not be honored. Against my better judgement, I kept the flight with Allegiant. I would soon regret that decision. First we had an extremely delayed flight 729, then a cancelled flight 729. Then an extremely inept and rude support staff that communicated sporadically if at all. To add to that, we had damage to all three of our bags, one of which is now completely unusable. Then it took 2 hours to get a hotel voucher. We were promised a meal voucher for $8.00 per person but they didn't manage to get those to us before the newly rescheduled flight 5729 departed at 7 am Central the next morning. We had to cancel our hotel reservation which wasn't fully refundable because we didn't provide a 24 hour notice (620.00 for 2 nights only one refundable). Moreover, the hotel we booked after cancelling the original was 45 minutes away from our destination meaning we also had to rent a car (105.00).

Allegiant Air,2,Lauren Murdock,12th March 2016,"I have flown Allegiant air multiple times with my family when travelling to Florida. Many Canadians who live near the border have no problem making the commute to save hundreds on flights with Allegiant (myself included). Last time I flew with Allegiant I was 4 months pregnant, the air temperature system in the cabin was not working. The airline was aware of this and did not notify the passengers ahead of time. Therefore, we had to fly in a cabin that had a temperature of around 55 degrees in the back of the plane and 80 in the front for 4 hours. Since we were flying in the middle of summer, I can assure you that people were not prepared for the cold. I ended up moving seats up to the front because I became so cold and uncomfortable. An elderly woman tried to move into an unoccupied seat at the front of the aircraft and was told that she would have to pay extra for that seat. We assumed that the plane would be grounded due to the malfunction but they barely unloaded us before the loaded the next passengers on the return flight without fixing the problem.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BGR to PIE,July 2015,1,1,1,,3,2,no

Absolutely everything beyond a seat on the plane costs extra. I booked a very cheap flight and knew what I was getting so I was pleased. The Allegiant personnel in OKC were wonderful and helpful. I was putting my teenager on a plane alone for the first time and they offered, without me asking, to give me a gate pass to walk her through security and to the gate. Great, friendly service. To avoid extra, surprise charges, read all the info on their website. Book all luggage when you book the flight or incur greater charges at the airport. Even carry on luggage costs.

Allegiant Air,1,Kimberly Davis,8th March 2016,"The process of booking a ticket and having to add all the little extra fees is a nightmare. You think you are getting a good deal but after adding in a fee for everything other than the air to breathe in flight it is not a savings as they would have you think. The representatives in the airport are a non professional, non friendly group of individuals. We encountered this on both ends of our trip but particularly worse in South Bend Indiana. My sister and I were traveling with my elderly parents and were seated two rows apart and they would not allow us to board together because we were seated in different ""zones"". They really had no desire to understand my parents requiring our assistance. Unloading of the plane is a monkey circus free for all of people rushing the door and dropping bags on your head rather than Allegiant considering the departure to be by rows to avoid this chaos. Attendants have no problem placing your carry on's rows behind your actual seat only making departure that much more difficult. Overall experience was unpleasant and I will definitely consider another airline in the future even if I have to pay a few more dollars. Savings not worth the lack of professionalism.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to SBN,March 2016,1,1,3,,1,2,no

A hard learned expensive lesson. However; I have been trying to rectify this. I had waited on the phone for nearly 3 hours in 4 calls over 2 days before I spoke to customer service. She gave me instructions to call back with a specific date and although there would be costs they would work with me. After more than an hour waiting, again, I got another representative. I told her what I had been told. She was curt. Matter of fact. To change $408 reservation was going to cost an additional $75 per person. Plus $300 for a change fee. And possibly additional charges. I chose Allegiant because they were supposed to be affordable. I told her I would just cancel. I didn't want the $56 they would return to me. I was never going to do business with them again. I didn't yell. I didn't curse. I was not happy. But I wasn't rude. She hung up on me. After 4 hours waiting on the phone. Tonight I went to the website to cancel. Says I can't.

Allegiant Air,2,Dennis McNamara,6th March 2016,We flew Allegiant Air Wednesday night to Ft. Lauderdale from Syracuse. We were told by friends that the reputation for Allegiant was that they were always late. We experienced this in the extreme. The original flight time was 6:45PM. We received a text that it was moved back to 7:55PM. We finally boarded at 8:30PM and took off at 11:30PM. After leaving the terminal we needed to de-ice but after de-icing the pilot announced that we didn't have enough fuel to make it to FLL so we had to return to the terminal. After re-fueling we then needed to de-ice. How could the pilot not know that the fuel was not sufficient before we left the terminal the first time? We finally arrived in Ft. Lauderdale at 2:30AM. The attendants were very cavalier and seemed to have the attitude that this happens all the time.

I reported the issue and was informed that because our delay was not long enough they could not compensate me for any convenience. I am 70 years old and it is not a pleasure to get on and get off a airplane. Was very disappointed in Allegiant for allowing their fleet of planes to become so unstable with mechanical problems.

Allegiant Air,3,M Poteat,26th February 2016,"We have flown with Allegiant Air many times over the past several years and I believe this last experience will be our last. While it's nice to have a non-stop flight to one of our favorite traveling destinations (Orlando/Disney World), I believe it's no longer worth it. With the cost of flights increasing plus they price gouge you for everything including check in luggage (which is only 40 pounds max), carry on luggage, picking your seat per person per flight, in-flight snacks/beverages, and now recently they've added on a charge to print off your boarding ticket at the counter. This last flight I truly witnessed how they love to price gouge their customers. My husband and I did not want to pay the fees to have to sit together - I think it's ridiculous that an airline should charge for this - it should be a courtesy. However, the airline will deliberately separate you and when you do an online check-in the night before, they will show you that you are separate, that you can't change it at the counter and that you have to pay $$ if you don't want to sit next to a stranger. I was 31 weeks pregnant and we were placed at two opposite ends of the plane, me row 14 and my husband row 29. Two rows in front of my husband were two empty seats where we could have been placed together. Also, next to me was a young single girl who could have been moved elsewhere very easily, and also about 5 rows behind me were two additional empty seats. Of course the staff tells everyone not to switch seats. Just goes to show how Allegiant Air doesn't really care about taking care of their customers, they just want your money. It's sickening to me and instead of paying that fee so I can sit next to my husband, we're choosing other airlines from now on. Plus I maybe ran into one friendly person the entire round trip flight.

Instead of nickel and diming you to death, they should get rid of half their flight attendants. They were so unkept I could hardly believe it. Sloppy uniforms and dirty messy hair. The two up front by us were extremely immature. The one reading on the PA system read so fast she screwed up time and time again. Other than try and sell snacks, they did absolutely nothing. Our two ""young ladies"" talked loudly amongst themselves constantly. One of them stood up front eating breakfast on a 2 hour flight. An elderly gentleman needed to use the rest room during turbulence and wasn't allowed to help make sure he didn't fall. OK, so it is their rule, but the exchange was less than friendly and his fellow passenger ended up helping him. Our fares could be more reasonable if they just got rid of half of their under qualified useless attendants.

Well how do you charge someone and not tell them?! That is what their people told me and I could only get a voucher with an extention (which I pushed for because we are not sure when we can go again). Then I get an invoice last night that says the reason I was charged is due to my checked bag being overweight.

On top of that, any time a customer calls customer service there is always a 30-40 minute wait to get a real person on the phone only to have them argue with you about a reimbursement or to hang up on you. this airline is cheap and bad at doing business. They are not dependable nor customer focused.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,AZA to IDA,July 2015,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,Cindy Pappert,14th January 2016,"First time I flew Allegiant Air, it was recommended by a friend. I was impressed with the amount I paid, everyone was very nice. I have never flown alone so i was nervous but the stewardess told me if I was still nervous to let her know and they would do everything possible to keep me at ease. The plane was clean. My flight arrived early and was a great ride. I will continue to fly this airline they make it affordable to come home to see family more often. give them a try.

Allegiant Air,3,G Arizala,4th January 2016,"For the most part, my experience with Allegiant has, thankfully, not been like many of the experiences other reviewers have encountered. For the most part, Allegiant, at least, when I flew them, got me there on time. However, the ground staff is pretty much unfriendly as ever. On a flight from LAS-HNL, the flight attendants have been the best part of the flight, smiling and courteous, so no gripes there, though of course sometimes they're a bit of a mixed bag, and on one flight from EUG-LAS, I had one flight attendant that was a bit rude. However, on my recent flight from HNL-LAS, there was an unexpected delay with little to no apologies. Got to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and when boarding time was supposed to happen, the Flight Attendants were still sitting at a locked door, chatting away. The Flight crew showed up 15 minutes later, and even then it took 30 minutes until they could enter. Even then, there were still more unexpected delays due to seatbelt and reseating issues. Which they didn't even bother to announce. I only knew about it because I overheard Flight attendants talking about it. For the most part, Allegiant, in my experience at least, isn't the absolute worst airline. You do get what you pay for. However, with outrageous fees, limits on bags, really tight and uncomfortable seating, and just horrible service, I'm going to have to say Allegiant isn't really an airline you should consider flying.",Boeing 757-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to LAS,December 2015,1,3,1,,1,4,no
Allegiant Air,1,K Berglund,3rd January 2016,"Bangor to Orlando. Worst experience I've ever had flying. My flight to Orlando was delayed by 6 hours because the plane was broken and we needed to be sent a new plane. The Allegiant staff at the Bangor airport were rude and not helpful. I asked to have my return fight changed to compensate for losing almost a full day with my parents, and they said no and offered no apologies or explanations. However, after calling the customer service number, they had no problem changing my return flight and happily did so. My return flight had an emergency landing in Rhode Island, and the pilot announced that the engine was overheating. We landed safely in RI and were greeted with about 6 firetrucks as soon as we landed. We waited hours before having an updates from Allegiant as to what was going to happen to us. At first they said they'd bus us to Bangor, but ended up putting us all in hotel rooms for the night and we flew out the next morning at 11am. Only one Allegiant flight attendant on the morning flight apologized for our inconvenience. The Warwick airport workers (not Allegiant staff) were excellent and accommodated us as well as they could, given the circumstances. I would not recommend Allegiant to anyone, despite the cheap prices. Not to mentions all the hidden fees.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BGR to MCO,December 2015,2,1,1,,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,Joseph Rainaldi,30th December 2015,"Los Angeles to Eugene. When booking my flight I was excited about the opportunity to fly home for the holidays at an affordable price. For a college student this pricing was exceptional but the price is only possible for Allegiant Air because they have many add on and hidden fees. When checking in at the front desk it was 30$ extra to have my small backpack taken on as a carry-on, 5$ to have your ticket printed, and something like 7$ for any on plane amenity. The staff was not very helpful and the flight attendants rudely snapped at guest to get their attention. The seats were old and the crew seemed to be more inclined to gossip as opposed to serve the customer.

They kept telling us at the gate that it was due to refueling, deicing fluid trucks, crew time out, and so forth. When customers started asking for vouchers then it was due to weather and not what we had been told. Don't bother calling their call center because they will just tell you to submit your complaint online and they won't help you at all!

Allegiant Air,1,Scott Schendorf,27th December 2015,"Allegiant Air's business model is interesting, take the outlying markets and offer direct flights to tourist destinations. This sounds good helping these areas and providing a service right? The problem are added fees that quickly take those savings away and reliability issues that may leave you a day or more late. If you look for a direct flight from an outlying market its appealing, flying in non-reclining seats so tight you can't open a book, delayed or rescheduled at their convenience due to aging aircraft, it may be worth the chance. When you get on board the fun continues with what are most likely the rudest staff I've ever encountered, budget constraints dictate staff caliber also apparently.

In addition to your base ticket price, get ready for $5 for ticketing, $50 for carry-on, $50 for checked bag, $15+ for a seat selection.

Yesterday afternoon we should have been on a 2:49 pm flight and they said the flight was diverted and would be late. The times for arrival kept changing. The plane finally got us to Greenville SC late in the evening. No apology except by the captain in flight. If you don't like the high risk of being late then go for the no frills ride.

Allegiant Air,1,K Bettinger,22nd December 2015,"Most horrible experience flying I have ever had. I have flown all over the world and I have never been angry about delays, flight cancellations because they happen and I'm a reasonable person who can deal if a curve ball is thrown. Allegiant air has no rhyme or reason for anything. They don't give you a straight answer. It took me 11 hours to get to Arizona from Ogden Utah. They first told us it was on behalf of the 3 inches of snow outside. This was untrue because had the plane been on time we would have missed the snow entirely. Then they stated that a plane was coming for us but was diverted to St. George to refuel. There is no allegiant hub in St. George. Then they told us that the plane from St. George was on it's way back but that is not the plane we will be taking anymore. Then they told us the plane we are taking had mechanical difficulties so we will continue to be delayed. The most frustrating part of this whole ordeal was that we couldn't get a straight answer from anyone. Allegiant refused to refund out flight as well as refused to offer any kind of voucher for our extreme inconvenience. They wouldn't let me talk to any supervisors on the customer service line and refused to give me any names of the customer service agents. This is not the first time I have flown with Allegiant and it is not the first time I have been given the run around story of why they can't keep a schedule. I will not fly this airline again. If you value you your job and need to be back at work when you say you will instead of stranded in another state do not fly with Allegiant. Cheaper fares? After they nickle and dime you for everything from bringing your own purse, to charging you for a half a can of soda, you end up saving maybe 100 bucks. Not worth the 11 hours waiting and missing out on family time over thanksgiving. Thanks for nothing Allegiant.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,OGD to AZA,November 2015,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,Conner Stroud,22nd December 2015,"I flew from Greenville to Orlando and the plane got to the gate when we were supposed to start boarding, then they had to deplane and then clean the plane. It was a 45 minute delay which wasn't that big of a deal. The real problem when I was set to depart from Sanford. Apparently there was a weather advisory and no minor could get on the plane alone. I have never heard of this rule before, a flight attendant said that she would watch over me so I could go and I thought everything was ok, then when I start to board the agent said that the flight attendant has changed her mind and that I will have to find another flight. I pleaded to get on the plane because this was today December 22nd and I needed to get back to see my family.

Allegiant Air,10,J Bartlett,18th December 2015,"We've flown on Allegiant a half dozen or so times and are very happy with every aspect of all our flights. When we flew in October, the incoming plane had mechanical issues in Fl, and our flight eventually was delayed overnight. Allegiant processed the full plane of passengers as quickly as they could and got anyone who had to travel over 30 minutes to get home put up in a local hotel. As we waited in line for our hotel vouchers, the crew passed out bottled water and chocolates and chatted with us to help ease the wait. In addition to a night in a hotel (which probably cost them more than what we paid for our flight to begin with!) we each got a $100 voucher for future travel - we are using it in January and will end up flying round trip from NH to FL for $13, plus the cost of picking our seats because my hubbs likes a window, and because of motion sickness, I need an aisle seat - and we both like the extra leg room seats. So for a grand total of $79, we have the seats of our choice and round trip fare. I find Allegiant customer service to be quite pleasant. The seats are as OK as most that I have had on other airlines - it's a 3 hour flight, I can sit in almost anything as long as I have room for my longish legs. All in all, we continue to fly Allegiant and are very happy with their rates, their service, and their airline in general. We are minimalist and can each fit what we need for a 10-12 day stay into a bag that conforms to Allegiant's standards for a free personal item that stows under the seat in front of us - but, having said that, if we needed to check bags, it would be more than worth the extra charge since parking at the terminal in Portsmouth, NH is free. If we were to go to Manchester or Boston to fly, we'd have to pay probably over $100 to park for 10-12 days",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portsmouth to Sanford,October 2015,3,5,3,,5,5,yes

That is further away than if we had stayed in Vegas. Our vehicle is still in Rapid. As we sit on the tarmac in Sioux Falls we are waiting for another plane to leave gate so we can get off plane.

I'm not the type of person who needs bells and whistles when I fly. I just want to get to my destinations safely. I should add I have a massive fear of flying and taking off scares me greatly. You can get your alcohol and snacks like with anyone else.

The price is right, and my husband and I are able to pack both of our things in one suitcase, so we only have to pay to check one bag. You are allowed a personal item free of charge, so I normally use a backpack. I've never been cold on an allegiant flight, normally warm. Though temperature varies and that's to be expected with any airplane. I've never encountered a rude stewardess. In fact we've had the same male stewardess for all of our flights back from Florida, who is friendly and personable. Seats aren't the most comfortable, however I can deal with it for 3.5 hours. I always buy a few drinks from the airport, and pack snacks from home, so that I can avoid having to pay for something on the plane. Restrooms are fine.

Allegiant Air,2,Deborah Thomas,9th December 2015,"Flew Allegiant Air from Mesa, Arizona to Grand Rapids, Michigan. There are some outstanding features of Allegiant Air, such as being able to book your flight only a week out and still get a decent fare. That is their best quality. However they charge you for everything after the standard fare, for your seat selection, for insurance, for both checked luggage and a carry on, and they allot you only 40 pounds maximum, not 50. They give you no drinks and no snacks. I asked for a cup of water to refill my water bottle and was denied. Only water for medicine taking, I was told. The seats are the worst feature. They are hard molded plastic with no padding in the backs and little padding in the seat itself. I have osteoporosis and when I finished my four hour trip, I had knots in my upper back and aching muscles in my lower back. No matter what position you try, it is uncomfortable,. There is no elastic seat bag in front of you to hold things in, like your water or a pen or kleenex. Only an open hard plastic slot that is not enclosed. All food costs money. You are restricted from standing in line to use the bathroom and there is no way to get out your seat in time to make it there before someone else closer beats you out. You board the plane from a covered staircase in the outdoors. The seats are very narrow and anyone who is large or tall cannot help but spill over into your space, making for a cramped and painful position for hours. I think Allegiant needs to strip their interiors to the floor and get all new comfortable seats five across, not six, and their customers would come back instead of quit, like me.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AZA to to GRR,December 2015,1,2,1,1,3,2,no

The last time we flew in Oct, our 6:45 PM flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues with the plane before it left FL to come to NH. Although Allegiant employees rarely have flights cancelled, and are not regularly using the cancellation procedures, the Portsmouth staff treated us with respect and kindness. They made arrangements for us to be put up in a local hotel that offered free breakfast. They passed out bottles of water and Lindt chocolates as we waited in line. Allegiant had us on our way to Sanford early the next afternoon. The plane we flew down on, was a different one than we were originally booked on, and the extra leg room we paid for wasn't available. Allegiant credited that extra charge back to our debit card, and gave us each a voucher for $100 toward future travel. Considering we can book flights for $54 one way, that's a good deal in my mind. We are not employees of Allegiant, nor are we related in any way to any employees. We are 2 people who appreciate a good value. We have learned the art of minimal baggage and can get by for 10 days with what will fit in the free personal item that will fit under the seat. We pay a great rate for only what we use.

Friends had warned me it might not be pleasant, but I gotta hand it to Allegiant. For about $120, they got me on time to where I wanted to go - far less than what I would have paid on a larger airline. And it was one of the best crews I've seen on any flight. Everyone gets the same seat on the A320, doesn't recline, no roomy pocket to store stuff. But the seat was comfy, and it got me there. Boarding was a breeze, they're very upfront about all the extras they charge for, so if you know that ahead of time, it's perfectly fine. The staff was great, some of the best service I've ever experienced. Everyone was friendly, helpful, even the captain came out and said goodbye as everyone was getting off the plan (both flights). A woman two seats over suffered from awful motion sickness on the return flight/landing, and the flight attendant was amazingly helpful. Got her an ice pack, stood there for about 10 minutes and fanned her with a safety card to cool her down, talked to her the whole time. Very wonderful service.

The plane was delayed because of mechanic issues and it wasn't until hrs later that they decided to fly in another plane in which I lost a day on my trip because of this. Which I was ok with being that it was mechanical issues involved. Yesterday I decided since I'm traveling with my 18 month old I would check in online, checked my bags, paid for an extra bag and express boarding pass, etc. Once I arrived at the airport just to make sure I approached the counter where I was told my flight was delayed again. Took my time going upstairs to security. Once at security I was informed I needed to go back downstairs for a printed boarding pass since the online one didn't mentioned I was traveling with a lap child. Very irritating issue update the app so that information is available! Once again go to the counter tell her situation asked for my info again. Only to get ""oh you're flying to Boise - that flight is on time!"" Long story short I ended up missing my flight because of not 1 but 2 people giving the wrong information even though they knew I was flying to Boise. The next plane I could board was on Thursday.

There was very little warning, hardly any explanation, no compensation, and little communication. After we spent more money on hotels and made arrangements for family and jobs, they cancelled that flight as well. Supposedly they rescheduled the flight to Thursday. Not to mention, the first flight was over an hour delayed because of missing paperwork. Allegiant Air has put a huge damper on what was a wonderful trip.

I had to arrive on the original flight day because of business. Was told I could reschedule in next 2 weeks but no refund. Had to book on another airline. Weather was beautiful at departing and arriving cities. They just lost a loyal customer. I saved $100 when I booked the original flight.

Allegiant Air,7,Derek Boles,28th October 2015,"I have flown Allegiant Air several times and the experience has been just fine concidering the huge savings. My family of 4 flies to SW Florida for vacation each year and we can fly direct from our local airport 1.5 hour flight. Our latest trip ran $412 plus $140 for 2 checked bags. The next least expensive option was American. It would have been $2332 plus $100 for 2 checked bags. It also includes a connection in Charlotte and takes 4 hours. Nearly $1900 less. The difference is less than our vacation rental is for the entire week after taxes and cleaning. I always get my boarding pass online and check the bags with a sky cap. You just show your boarding passes on your phone to the gate and you're on the plane. Alot of people on here are saying they'd pay more for larger carrier and I have to say go ahead. I also can't agree that the airline nickel and dimes people. I'll happily pay less for things I don't need. As for the customer service, I never need anything from them so I let them do their job. Of course they're rude when people complain all the time about everything.

Allegiant Air,1,Carolyn Corwin,24th October 2015,"Allegiant Air lure you in with low cost fare, but then charge you for everything. You have to pay for your per seat assignment, carry on, checked baggage, your boarding pass if printed at the terminal will cost you $5, if you want a drink on your flight that will cost you $2. They only allow your checked bag to be 40 pounds so if you fly a major airline and then connect with Allegiant it you are going to be fined an additional $50 for that bag that weighs 50 lbs which is in compliance with the other airlines. It is a total nickle and dime operation. In the end I paid as much for their flight, perhaps even more, than flying a major airline. They even close their check in counter 40 minutes prior to boarding time, so if you're a tad late, you can't even get on the plane! Their boarding time is 1 hour prior to flight, rather than the normal 1/2 hour.

The return trip was a nightmare. We were told several times that our flight had been delayed before it was finally cancelled. It was not due to weather. We looked at their website and saw that there had been about 10 cancellations that day and also the day before. One flight out of Bellingham WA had been cancelled two days in a row. We read of a possible pilot's strike and since we needed to get home, we booked a return flight on Delta at a cost of $600.00. I have since read reviews about poor maintenance on their airplanes.

You are the one that ends up paying out when you check in. Their employees don't have the ability to correct it. They can only do what their computers allow them to do.

Finally they brought in a different airline to fly us home. We paid extra for my husband and I to sit together in reserved seats and we were put on opposite ends of the jet. Then we tried again in September 2015. Our flight was delayed several times then finally they boarded us only to have everyone unboard the jet. Waited another two or more hours and they finally cancelled the flight all together. We had to drive back home and arrived at 1:30 in the morning. The next night we flew out and not on the jet we were suppose to be on but at least we made it to Arizona. To come back home they had to put us on a new jet again and my this time we had eight of us in my family. They scattered us around the jet to fill in empty seats. Expected my grandsons (ages 2 and 3) to sit with strangers! It was horrible! I am so done with this airline. I understand some problems once in awhile but this was three times in a row for my family.

Half an hour later pilot says ""due to a miscommunication, we were supposed to be at a different gate"" so he turned the corner and there were about a hundred people waiting for our plane to board and an entire ramp crew waiting to deplane us.

I had no issues and we will definitely fly this airline again. I see people complaining about buying refreshments on the flight. This can be avoided by buying a drink after you go through security and bringing snacks from home if you don't want to buy the snacks. This flight was $400 cheaper than the other airline.

I do not know why anyone would complain about paying for a beverage or a snack when the flight rates are so affordable compared to other airlines. I have found the total price is more affordable even when you pay for luggage, snacks, and a seat than the major airlines. I love the direct flight since you do not have to worry about luggage being transferred to a different plane or hurry to a concourse so you don't miss your connecting flight. I have found the flight attendants to be very kind and accommodating. It would be more convenient if they flew out of each town daily in the event a flight was cancelled.

The flights are late, and about 1 out of every 2 times flights are delayed because the crew is late or the plane is late or the plane just has mechanical problems and they cancel your flight. That makes it really bad since they only fly certain days. I will finally just give up and use another airline and pay the extra $'s and drive a little farther. I say use only if you have to.

Allegiant Air,4,N Golovanov,20th September 2015,"Coming to Abe just 1 hour prior to to my flight, the airport was almost empty and security was a breeze. Just remember that with Allegiant Air if you check in and get your boarding pass at the airport, you will have to pay 5$. Also note that you have to pay a fee up to 35$ just to use the overhead bins! So basically the only thing you can bring on a plane for free is a small personal item that will fit in the seat in front of you. On my flight from Abe (Lehigh Valley) to Myrtle Beach, the flight was delayed about 2 hours because of technical issues on an outdated MD-80. Once on the plane, the seats were comfortable, even though they had pretty tight legroom. On the way back, our flight departed 5 minutes early amd was on time, however this time on a much newer A320.

Flight from FLL was delayed about an hour due thunderstorms, lightning in the area, and some airport related fueling issues but nothing the fault of the airline. No big deal to us, we were coming off a cruise and were in no rush anyway. The plane we flew on was a freshly refurbished A320 originally from Iberia and looked very fresh with new paint, interior, and seats. The slimline seats aren't bad for a couple hour flight (I'm 6'0"") and as long as you learn how to fly and pack for the discount airlines like Allegiant Air or Frontier you won't be shocked when you either book or arrive at the airport. Do your research and read before you book and they'll get you from point A to B which in reality is all we needed. Flew Frontier on the way down to FLL and it was a similar experience and seats. Only difference I noticed was that Frontier provides you with free cups of ice water where as Allegiant asks you to pay for even that but thats a non issue to us. Flight crew was nice and pilot was humorous during his announcements. All in all as I mentioned before if you simply do your homework and know what to expect on low cost airlines you should not have any reason to complain and they'll get you where you need to go.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnati,September 2015,3,5,,,4,4,yes
Allegiant Air,1,M Sorn,19th September 2015,"We will never fly Allegiant Air again. I used to suggest this airline to my friends and family in and from Rockford, IL because they fly directly from Rockford to the east valley and spared us the drive from Chicago. Let me tell you, the drive from Chicago is well worth it if you don't have to deal with this awful excuse of an airline. For some stupid reason, my husband and I decided to use Allegiant Air for a trip back to Rockford, IL for my grandmother’s 90th birthday. We had been planning this trip for a year. Both my husband and I are veterans so I have flown in everything from a 4-seater plane, a 12 seat passenger plant, a C-5 Galaxy, to a large civilian plane from Kuwait to Amsterdam to Chicago. In all that time I have never come close to experiencing such incompetence and poor customer service as I did when attempting to fly with this joke of an airline. Having used this airline a few times, I knew that check in and security took approximately 15-20 minutes, which was a good thing considering there are no amenities in the airport for your wait after check in except for some vending machines. We arrived at the long term parking about an hour and a half before our flight. We watched two buses pass us right by until we ran after one and caught it before it left us as well. That wait cost us almost 30 minutes. When we arrived at the check in gate there were no other passengers in line. We arrived at the ticket counter and the girl at the desk said she could print out our boarding passes but it would cost and extra $5 each. That’s not a huge deal, but she said she could download the app on my phone and we wouldn’t have to pay the fee. We weighed our bags and had to move some things around to make weight. The girl at the desk suggested different ways to move things about and was telling anecdotes about overweight bags and such and didn't seem in any rush at all. Then she started messing with my phone to download the app for the free boarding pass. Once again, there was no sense of urgency or warning. This process took about 15 minutes. Once she finished with my phone, she informed us that it was now too late to print our boarding pass and we wouldn’t be able to board the plane. She said Allegiant Air had a policy that they stopped printing boarding passes 40 minutes before the flight. Our flight was at 1:51 and the time when she told us this was 1:13, meaning it was 38 minutes before our flight. We were literally denied our flight because of 2 minutes and the plane was still sitting in the tarmac! Allegiant Air flights are delayed, so there was even more available time than that. We would have been able to make the flight if she had just told us that we didn’t have time to mess around with the stupid phone app and our luggage beforehand! We brought this up and she tried to tell us that we were too late when we walked up to the desk. Um, if it was too late at that point, then why in the world did she tell us to download the app and mess around with our luggage? Shouldn't she have told us that as soon as we walked up to the counter instead of chatting away for another 15 minutes? She said that we could reschedule for the following Monday for $75 per person.

They can not adjust baggage fares or do anything outside of shoving you on the plane. When you need assistance you are handed a piece of paper with a phone number to call. When you call, you have a minimum 30 minute wait to speak to a human. This is particularly frustrating when there are 4 helpless human agents standing in front of you.

The airport out of St Pete is small and very easy to navigate, not crowded when I went. I would say the price is decent, I stayed at a 3.5 star hotel and got a nice rental car.

After reading reviews I realized I would not be saving any money compared to another airline (they do charge for absolutely everything on top of the apparently cheap fare) however I still chose them because they were flying direct from our small local airport, at a time of day that was convenient for me. Crew was friendly and efficient. They walked us through the process of doing a few things on our Iphone right at the airport, instead of making us pay for them to do it (like printing boarding passes for instance, and checking in more luggage). So yes, they were aware that the airline charges for a lot of stuff but they were more than happy to show us ways to cut down on our spending a bit. Aircraft was fairly new. No bells and whistles: very basic seats that do not recline, and no personal TV monitor. Oh well, it was a 2.5 hour flight, and I was not expecting anything luxurious. I was just happy to get to my destination safely and on time. That's pretty much all I ask of an airline these days, especially at this price! No problem with baggage delivery.

Sat on the plane for 2 hours before departing gate. While backing out of gate a loud noise was heard, plane went back to gate where we sat for another 2 hours waiting for mechanics.

Flight cancelled, $8 vouchers handed out for food, but nothing open in the airport by then. Hotel vouchers given out, but most hotels they contracted with were full, or had no shuttles. We ended up paying for our own hotel, and we were finally able to get a room in at 1.30 am. Gate people were very nice and did everything in their power to help. My spouse and I did receive a total of $200 in flight vouchers. The plane took off the next day, late, but an uneventful flight.

Allegiant Air does not follow industry standards with regards to baggage weights. Instead of the standard 50 pounds for checked luggage they use 40 pounds as the maximum.

When I booked our last fights you see the ticket prices and think, that's a good or reasonable deal. You pay for every single aspect of the entire flight. You pay for your ticket in the following ways: two people traveling round trip- two tickets per person each way (180ish) okay reasonable, must pay approx $20 per seat per flight to pre select your seat (even in middle seat!), must pay for all checked bags, only allowed one carry on not two like other airlines, then pay $22 to pay for the tickets at check out to use a card. Then you have to pay $5 per person per flight to check in at the airport.

Thats what ppl should complain about it's a madhouse. As far as my flight it was perfect departed on time (that's never happened on other aircrafts I've flown in the past) so what if you have to buy your drinks etc for the price who cares to spend 2.00 extra on a flight.

Allegiant Air,2,A Green,31st August 2015,"This is my first time flying Allegiant, and I'm not impressed. I had to pay for baggage when I made my reservation, which was $50 for a checked bag. They also charge for carry-ons. Luckily, my fiancé and I just shared 1 checked bag to try to save money. We flew a different airline to Las Vegas but flew Allegiant on the way back. The other airline didn't weigh our bag because we paid one flat fee for our checked bag. Well Allegiant did weigh our bag and it weighed 51 pounds and they charged us another $50 so our 1 checked bag cost us $100 which was the cost for one of our plane tickets, which is outrageous. Other airlines usually only charge $25 and another $25 if it's over 50 pounds. Also, not to mention they do not offer a complimentary beverage.

I never actually had any major problems, but a few minor issues. After flying them about 3-4 times last year to come home, I quickly learned it is the same pilot and first officer, sometimes flight crew. They are all incredibly nice and even joke around with the 95% college student-filled flights.However, when I was flying home in May, my plane was supposed to leave at 9.26am for LAX. The night before at approximately 11.45pm, I get a call saying the plane is delayed two hours due to mechanical problems. I get to the airport the next morning and it is delayed another hour because the plane was delayed in SFO for weather-related issues. Finally board the plane and didn't have any issues. When I arrived for my flight back to EUG, it was delayed about 20 minutes, but had us board the plane anyway. The pilot tells us they were adding more gas just in case we are diverted to Portland which is 3 hours from Eugene.

Was going to fly with them again recently when I saw ad for $72 to Ft. Myers, but by the time they added $119 fee onto the ticket, it was more than Southwest. Plus their baggage fee of $40 is quite high, and Southwest has no baggage fee. I'll stick with Southwest or Spirit when it flies in season to Ft.

Got up early next morning to make 10:30 flight only to find it was delayed 4 hours. Made no sense as the plane from day before was still sitting waiting. Crew was sitting on floor of gate area waiting to access the plane. Their only concession was we were offered one bottle of warm water for our troubles (they had no ice). Cost me an extra $250, 200 extra miles and extra day on rental car. Filed claim but zero response. I have flown 6 flights with them and 4 had major delays or problems.

Allegiant Air,1,John Green,19th August 2015,"Very difficult for a UK resident to quickly comprehend this airlines status but if I was to say this Airline makes Ryanair look positively awesome then that will give you some indication of where this outfit rank. We took what was meant to be a 45 minute flight approx from Vegas to Fresno, 1.30 pm McClaren departure only to land 22.45 with what must be approx 200 other passengers. All of whom were deplaned twice, made to sit hours in a non a/c aircraft whilst the company did their utmost to not only lose customers but I think crew members also. To add insult to injury after the second deplaining customers were told to go to a different unmanned desk for meal vouch urge that arrived to coinside with most of the concessions closing except Burger King. To say communication was poor was being kind. All I would say to UK clients thinking of using this low cost domestic carrier is think again, with the exception of $8 dollars for food for my family of four apparently as a UK customer who spent over $1000 on the tickets I can get $200 against my next Allegiant flight.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fresno,August 2015,1,3,1,1,3,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,Jami Cadden,19th August 2015,"Both of my flights were delayed. The second of which was delayed several hours. I know it's a budget airline so you really do expect to pay for everything extra, but once you add everything together it really isn't much cheaper than a regular airline. After my flight was delayed multiple times they finally let us on the airplane, but because it was so late their app wouldn't work for my boarding Pass. I then had to stand to the side while others boarded, even though I paid for priority boarding. I was scolded by the flight attendant for not taking a screenshot of my boarding pass. When I walked into the airplane it was not air-conditioned at all and they said they were having trouble with air-conditioning. It was at least 90°. The plane was filthy with trash everywhere. We ended up delayed again while on the plane and they told us there were mechanical issues. Needless to say I ended up not flying with them that day. I did however end up at a major airport on a major airline. Never again.

Flight left as scheduled, flew for 30 minutes and then a Gauge stopped working, so they turned around and went back to Vegas. Said they would either have it fixed or an answer in 30 minutes. Finally at 9.30 they said they would be working on it to repair and print food ticket vouchers for everyone at 10 if it still wasn't fixed. 10 am and went 10.30 came and went with still no word. 11 they finally said wait 30 minutes and they would start loading the plane. 11.30 loaded half the plane and then unloaded it as something still wasn't right. At 12 12 they gave food vouchers, good for a whole 8 dollars. The whole time the flight crew were rude, no explanation, nothing. Finally got word that the new plane would be in at 1.30 and we would be on it. Finally at 2.30 we leave. They did give 50 dollar voucher, good for one year on an Allegiant flight.

Our flight out of LAX was delayed for 2 hours and they never apologized or gave a reason. On our 5+ hour flight, they charge for any food or beverage. They won't even give you water - it's $2. Also, the seats are crammed so close together your knees touch the seat in front of you and I'm 5' 9"" tall. The seats do not recline. The flight attendants were not very friendly. My seat had something wrong with it and was fairly uncomfortable as well. The plastic form that the thin cushion attached to was bent or something.

This is a ""shopping"" experience for sure when you book, you purchase everything separately, I did end up saving about $125 but it really wasn't worth it in the long run. Two hour delay (not weather related) which really screwed us up. Paid for one suitcase, but their weight limit was at 40 pounds, not the usual 50-and that ten pounds made a big difference-had to pay $5 each for boarding passes because we couldn't get their app to download on our phones, which was suspicious to me, since it was both of us unable to use it. I at least want some water on a flight without having to pay for it. So liked the direct flight, but reading the other reviews, we were not alone with what seems like a lot of delayed flights due to staff/plane management issues.",,Business,Economy Class,Syracuse (SYR) to St. Petersburg (PIE),August 2015,2,3,,,2,4,no

We arrived at the airport on time, flight was scheduled to depart on time, 1.34pm Florida time. We all boarded the plane and one of the flight attendants passed out and that caused a 45 minute delay, then we leave the gate to find that there is a mechanical issue with our plane, 90 minutes later we are at the runway taking off. We were in flight for 1 hour and was told we had to turn around and return as another mechanical error had occurred and we had to change planes. The flight that was to leave at 1.34 ended up not officially leaving Florida until 7.00pm causing us to have been on a plane for over 7 hours for a 2 hour flight.

The flight home was a different story. The staff at the counter were rude from the start. We had no opportunity to print our boarding passes, used the online service on their website and they refused to use them and charged us to print our boarding passes. My husband, who is disabled, was not able to carry his one personal bag and his cousin carried it for him. They told him that he would be charged if he carried it, even after he explained that is was for his cousin - who is clearly disabled and was at the counter. They did not care. Additionally, his wife was carrying a bag of snacks for us to eat while we were waiting for the flight. One of the counter staff said that he was going to charge her for that, even though she explained and they followed her to the gate and said something regarding it two more times.

Allegiant Air,2,M Minouche,12th August 2015,"My flight from Los Angeles to Montrose, Colorado was my first time flying the airline and it will be my last. Our flight on 8/7/15 from LAX to MTJ was delayed over 3 hours. The issue seemed to be mechanical. It was very confusing when the screen at the gate did not have the updated departure time despite the fact that passengers were receiving text message flight alerts with delayed flight times. At one point the screen at the gate even said ""now boarding"" which was obviously incorrect. When I asked a gate agent which information was accurate, they were not helpful and did not seem to be informed. My flight from MTJ (Montrose) on 8/10/15 was delayed 7 hours. We were told that the plane departed Los Angeles to come to Montrose and had to divert to Arizona for repairs. I should have just assumed that the flight would be delayed and waited to go to the airport. I want an airline to fix the necessary repairs on a plane that I'm about to fly, but it is unnerving when the repairs are happening while you wait for the very same plane. It would be much more efficient if the planes were constantly maintained so that these long wait times would not be necessary. I also think it is ridiculous to charge a customer for a cup of water on a flight when they've been waiting in a very small and very hot airport for over 7 hours.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to MTJ,August 2015,3,2,,,2,2,no

Had the bulkhead seats and were quite comfortable. Was a little surprised by the request to clean the area and set the seat belts for the crew. On our way home I was asked to remove my earbuds (not plugged into anything) before takeoff. This was quite surprising as I was using them as earplugs to drown out the sound of the young child behind me who was throwing a fit and kicking the seats. After I took out my earbuds I covered up with my wrap and tried to get some rest (it was an early morning).

On the return trip we were asked to general maintain the aircraft upon arrival at IWA. It wasn't much but isn't this why we pay so much for the airfare and two dollars for a glass of water?

It was a very long delay, we were scheduled to leave early morning and never departed until very late evening. They eventually re-routed another plane to Pittsburgh to fly us to Jacksonville. Delays and mechanic problems can happen, I wouldn't want to fly on a questionable aircraft. I believe Allegiant did all that they could do, things just happen. We were given water and snacks at the gate while we all waited and thank goodness for the great nearby bars/restaurants in the airport. Allegiant is a low cost budget carrier, so, you get want you pay for. A no frills airline. How can you complain even with the long delay, (mechanical problems and weather) do happen, the airlines doesn't have control over those things. For the cost of the flights, even with the carry on and boarding fees you can't beat their prices. You need to understand, that Allegiant does not have co-shares with the major airlines so they cannot put you on another flight with another airline, so you are stuck and have to wait for them to fix the problem. I'm sure they don't want unhappy customers any more than we want to be unhappy customers. I say give them a try, do plan extra time and remember, you are flying for a very low fare, decide if paying triple on a major airlines for the same flight is worth it.

To make matters worse, they cannot tell you when your flight will be. So now we are stranded in Raleigh, North Carolina waiting for either a phone call or text message to let us know when our flight will be.

The pilot gave out erroneous information about the situation during the delay. We were assured once we got to our destination that the rental car agency would be monitoring the flight and someone would be available to assist. Upon arrival no one was at the counter and the security guard said no one was ever available off hours no matter what the airline or rental car agency (Alamo) said. No Allegiant representatives were available or could be reached by phone. I tried Allegiant in an attempt to save a little money but by the time they add a fee for practically everything you end up paying the same price as other major airline for worse service and horribly uncomfortable seats.,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Phoenix,July 2015,1,3,,,1,1,no
Allegiant Air,3,S Ritchie,1st August 2015,"While waiting on the plane to land and to head off to Phoenix. It was an hour past the time it was supposed to land, so my wife asked the lady at the desk for an update as nothing was announced over the loud speaker. The lady was rude and unprofessional and answered in a rather rude manner. Then finally about 1.5hrs they announce something is wrong with the plane and it may be 2 hrs or so. So everyone waited patiently for about 2 hrs, then all of a sudden here comes that loud voice again and it said we don't have the part to fix it. There's no need to worry, But of course We are the ones that have been waiting for 3-4 hrs. Then they say a plane will be flying in from Florida to fix the plane in Ohio and it will be 2hrs till the plane arrives before they even attempt to fix the plane I will be riding. Keep in mind it's around the 5 hr mark now. Then they say if you want to give us your luggage we can return it to you, or if you stay we will have pizza! Really pizza? I did not sign up for a slumber party with strangers. Then to make things better the airport (not Allegiant) handed out cots so we're all camped out in the terminal.

Allegiant Air,1,Meghan Oatman,28th July 2015,"My family and I have flown with Allegiant Air at least two or three times a year from Cincinnati to Orlando/Sandford (back and forth) for several years now. Until Friday July 24 2015, our complaints have been minimal and at most had delayed departures because the planes weren't there yet! However, as of Friday July 24 2015, my family and I will no longer be flying Allegiant. We had an early flight out (6.45am), had checked in the night before, and arrived at 6.00am to depart as the airport is so small, it never takes more than 10 minutes to check in and get to gate. We couldn't find any signage indicating where to check bags through for Cincinnati and simply got in a line curbside because I had five days earlier experienced the same thing when dropping my son off to fly same route and had been directed there for checking his bag. We got in a fairly slow, long line and just as we reached the check-in attendant, after having been interrupted several times, she made the announcement baggage check in to Cincinnati, and several other cities was inside! We go back inside the Allegiant terminal, get in another line only to find out as we approached counter, we're told baggage check for Cincinnati was in Terminal A and pointed to a different area (one we never knew existed)! The attendant then tells us the flight just closed and we'd have to find another flight home and the fees would be $75 each person to do so. We explained we'd been there in lines trying to figure out where we were to check in and saw no indication Cincinnati was in Terminal A. To top it all off, the flight we were supposed to be on that closed at 6.10 had a thirty minute delayed departure. Had we known prior to arriving, we were to go to a different check in terminal, I would not be wasting my time sharing my negative review. We will be back to using sky miles again which is most likely less expensive in the long run as discount airlines like this one seem to nickel and dime customers anyway!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando/Sandford to Cincinnati,July 2015,3,3,2,,1,1,no

My son and I were looking for flights to North Carolina and searched Allegiant. We made our reservations to fly up on Friday, July 24th returning the evening of July 25th. I was pleased with our flight up to North Carolina. Nothing major to complain about. We did not have checked baggage as our trip was only one night. Around 2.30 Saturday afternoon I received a text stating that our flight had been cancelled and a website link. The link was for their main website and offered no options as to what to do. I immediately got on the phone to call them and had to wait an hour and 10 minutes on hold before someone could pick up. The lady I spoke to simply told me my flight had been cancelled. I responded by saying that's not a problem just put us on the next flight out this evening. I was told that the next flight out would be Monday afternoon (this is Saturday). I was told I could receive a refund for the flight and given no other options. I asked if the company was going to pay for my rental car, hotel and food expenses for the next 2 days.

Allegiant Air,1,Rae Barney,27th July 2015,"They promise cheap fares but you end up paying just as much as any other airline. Their ""fees"" are asinine. Once you pay the ""fare"" for their flight, you have to pay extra for each bag, including carry on luggage. If you don't pay online ahead of time for your bags you pay significantly higher prices to pay at the airport. You also must pay extra to choose a seat and extra for ""priority boarding"" and you are charged $5 if you do not print your boarding pass at home. I am sitting at home waiting for my flight, which has been delayed from 8.50pm departure to 10.15 to 10.45. I attempted to call them to find out if I should reasonably expect to leave today at all. I was on hold for 29 minutes, then hung up on. My second call resulted in a 57 minute hold after which I was told ""oh sorry"" for the hold and assured numerous times that there would be absolutely no further delays. I received two additional texts after that delaying my flight until midnight and then 1am. I am certain it is only a matter of time before it is cancelled completely. I am livid and have no recourse at this point because I don't want to waste many more hours trying to call them back or sitting in the airport waiting for the inevitable cancellation.

Allegiant Air,1,Tandi Spencer,19th July 2015,"We were to fly back to Pittsburgh on July 13, 2015 at 5.18 on flight 869. We boarded at about 5.00. When we entered the plane, it was extremely hot with 150 passengers. It was 95 degrees on the plane and there was no air blowing from the overhead vents. We waited on the tarmac to pull away from the gate for an hour in that heat. Flight attendants kept claiming the air would start as soon as we got up in the air and would cool down. Everyone was hot and complaining. Finally, the pilot said there was an error message and we had to get off the plane for maintenance to work on the issue. Maintenance showed up and could not fix it, we could not get another plane that night. After two hours they announced that we could find our own hotel up to $225 and would be reimbursed. The flight was rescheduled for 2.00pm the next day, which was inconvenient as the whole day is gone. We had plans for the next day just like every other passenger. The next day, we check in and I ask how to get reimbursed for food and hotel and the airport representative says she does not know if Allegiant is even reimbursing for food anymore. We show up for our flight and once again we don’t start boarding until 1.40. We notice that it’s the same plane. As we get on the plane, we realize it’s even hotter than the day before and even more uncomfortable. Once again, we take forever to board and we start to pull away from the gate. We are waiting on the tarmac for close to an hour as everyone is miserable and uncomfortable. I am pregnant, there were infants and toddlers that parents had to undress down to their diapers just to try and stay remotely cool.

The attendent said they would only sell me water and that was the only way I would be able to get any water on the flight. I was suprised and stated that I was under the impression that all airlines provide water to their patrons. She (the attendent) made sure to correct me and say if I wanted water I would have to purchase it. She was very unprofessional and rude.

We had to upgrade one of the bags we already paid for. Got through security just fine but the gate agent threatened to close the boarding door on my wife as I finished in security 20 mins before the flight left. We ended up being delayed leaving the gate because of a technical problem with the lavatory. The attendants yelled at several passengers because the did not put their phones away.

Because for a while, it was the only airline that I can find that went to my destination. But it began with 2 hour delays on the flight (they seem to only fly one plane in one route all day so if the first plane is behind, the entire day is lost). Don't expect anyone to be at the counter if you arrived 2 hours before your flight is supposed to leave. You must show up 2 hours before your flight is scheduled to leave because one of their favorite pastimes is making you wait on them. Once you actually board the plane (4 hours later) it's not so bad.

After 5 hour flight to Hawaii, we had to wait 35 minutes on the runway because of mismanagement concerning available gates to unload. We missed our connecting flight.

Many other people had to go to other airports that night to keep from missing cruises, etc. The flight on the way back was 2 hrs late to top it off.

Drinks and snacks on the plane will cost extra, but you can bring your own snacks for free of course if you think ahead. Seats are not as comfortable as a United or larger carrier, they don't recline and they aren't as cushy. But the upside is that my flight was a direct flight and the price was super low.

Just throw away your ticket since you can not make any changes, even for a fee online. We have waited on hold for hours trying to connect on the phone to a customer service agent only to be disconnected when their automated system tried to connect us to a representative. This happened multiple times. So if a Greyhound bus with wings with no service in the air on on the ground works for you, then Allegiant is your airline.

Considering that on any other airline, we would have a layover of at least this long, it has never deterred us. We always choose to pay for our seats close to the front and have never had an issue with the checked bag fees. As long as the item you bring with you will fit in under the seat in front of you, you can consider this item a personal item instead of a carry on. We have always managed to have our backpacks with us without any additional fees by putting them under the seat in front of us instead of in the overhead bins.

I am only 6'2 but my knees were nearly above the seat in front of me. Luckily no one sat beside me and I was able to swing off to the side. Yes the flight was very cheap. It was not worth it.

The flight attendants on my flight from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas Friday May 22nd were however extremely and unnecessarily rude. They instructed everyone to turn off their phones and I complied but left my noise-canceling earphones in because research shows decibel range while on an aircraft has been proved to cause hearing damage. She came over to me and said extremely rudely ""Are you coming to Las Vegas with us?"" I replied ""yes?"" She said ""Then you need to turn off your phone right now!"" I showed her that it had already been turned off. Even more rudely and insultingly she said ""Take out your earbuds now!"" I stated ""they are noise-canceling and that's why I have them in."" She said ""I don't care you need to take them out."" I was amazed at her lack of tact and insulting way of speaking to clients.

Allegiant Air,9,L Headley,18th May 2015,Flight 755 from New Orleans (MSY) to Indianapolis (IND) on May 8. For fear of delayed flights we only took Allegiant home from New Orleans to Indy because a delayed flight would negatively affect us less in that case. I'm sure in part we were just lucky with our plane customer service and such - our plane was fabulous. The seats were very comfortable. There was so much leg room. Our flight was on time to leave and land. The employees were a little disengaged but not rude. It wasn't an issue or a benefit. The only hiccup was the flight attendant who told us immediately that some seats including ours were getting some dripping and mist from some sort of condensation overhead. She moved us up 12 rows to avoid it. We were lucky that the plane was only 40-50% full so we had three seats to share between the two of us. Per sitting together I'm sure the less-than-full flight helped but we checked in right at the 24 hours prior mark which I hoped would better ensure us sitting together. I have no doubt anyone on the flight could've switched seats to be together in they wanted - perhaps flight attendants are kinder to do that than in-airport staff who don't want to make things hard on the inner staff? Tips: 1) Read all FAQ and prices. 2) Check in as early as possible. 3) Go in expecting potential delays and such. Will continue to use them.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,B Stoermer,12th May 2015,"5/3/15 flight 603. 5/9/15 flight 602. I have flown Allegiant a few times and they continue to amaze me with how poorly they run this airline. Customer service representatives seem to almost enjoy making your life more difficult. Every plane that I have flown has been extremely filthy as they try to save costs by not using a cleaning service. On the topic of costs they charge you for everything. Printing boarding passes at the airport choosing a seat inflight refreshments and even your carry-on luggage all cost extra. The weight limit on checked luggage is 40 lbs vs the standard 50 lbs the rest of the industry uses. When you add up all the costs it is no cheaper to fly this ""budget"" airline than it is to fly with a more reputable company. Buyer beware!",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,7,M Wellnitz,8th May 2015,"Overall our experience flying Allegiant was pleasant and as expected (flew from PIA to PIE). They are very particular and charge for every ""extra"" along the way but to be able to take my family on a direct flight from our local airport at such a low cost is worth any perceived hassle. Flight out was delayed by about 30 minutes return flight arrived early. We were traveling as a party of 6 (including 1 lap child) and were able to get seats together on both flights even though we had not paid for assigned seats in advance. Not sure if this was because the flight was not full or if we just lucked out. I had to check in at the airport with our infant so got a paper ticket there but needed to check in the rest of the group using their app to avoid the $5 ticket fee. The app had assigned seats all together when we checked in. Unfortunately on the way back we were running late to the airport and they close the online check-ins 60 minutes before departure so we were forced to pay the $5 fee for the additional tickets (the agent gave us all seats together without us even asking). We choose to take two checked bags and each had a personal item. I was surprised by the very small dimensions for the personal items they didn't seem to be monitoring closely the size of these at our airports but I wasn't wanting to be caught with a surprise carry-on fee so we made sure our luggage fit within the size limitations. We did get caught on the way back with one overweight bag but they gave us an opportunity to move things into our personal items to avoid the extra weight fee. Total cost for 5 round-trip airfare tickets with 2 checked bags was",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Stacey Kidder,5th May 2015,We flew round-trip Grand Rapids to Orlando. Never again. We knew prior to booking that we would need to pack light because of the baggage policy. We packed together (my husband and I) and checked one bag. We downloaded the app to our phones so we didn't have to pay for the boarding passes. We checked in and paid for luggage before hand to avoid any extra fee for that too. What we didn't expect was to purposely have our seats separated since we did not 'purchase' seats beforehand. You would think that when a husband and wife book 2 plane tickets together at the same time that they would put these two seats together. Big parties sure I can understand why they couldn't all be seated together but two people? Come on. Leaving Grand Rapids the man at the counter rolled his eyes and muttered the seats numbers and letters and that was it. Changed our seats to be together since there was room on the plane which is only fair. The lady at the Orlando ticket counter was a completely different story. She was rude and disrespectful. She insisted that there was no reason we should have to sit together if we didn't have children with us laughed when I told her she was being rude and refused to change our seats even though there was room on the plane to do so. She kept saying this was the policy and no seats were to be given for free. We paid for 2 seats on a plane we didn't want any specific seats we just merely wanted to sit together since we were going on a kid-less vacation and wanted to enjoy our time together. If there are 2 seats together that are open why couldn't we move to them without being charged? The nickel and diming for the baggage fine I get it. Purposely putting 2 passengers separate because you want more money out of them even when there is vacant seats? Distasteful. The flight attendants were less than helpful didn't look too thrilled to be working here either. The ride back to Grand Rapids left a terrible taste in my mouth and now Allegiant has lost me as a customer.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,9,K Schemansky,1st May 2015,Allegiant airline was exactly what I thought it would be - a cheap direct flight no frills but efficiently and effectively got me from point A to point B. I was very worried having read all the reviews but most people only come to sights like this when they have negative things to say but I can't say anything extremely negative - sure the seats didn't recline and weren't very comfortable and I wasn't given free snacks/drinks but I knew this going in. Will definitely fly Allegiant again! Great value.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,G Mich,30th April 2015,April 2015 - South Bend Indiana to Punta Gorda FL. The extra charges are absolutely ridiculous - we pay for our seats for our carry-ons to take it inside the plane extra 100$ if we want a carry-on to be checked we pay extra charges if we pay with credit card we pay even for a printed boarding pass. All these services are free on major airlines. And then the flights are very frequently very late. Our flight was 5 hours late. Awful service the worst airline. They advertise the lowest prices but all the extra charges added up to a final ticket more expensive than Delta and it's not worth it anymore. Also be aware that if you reserve rental cars through Allegiant when you pick-up the car you will pay all the taxes that have not been added to your ticket and these are substantial. I will not fly Allegiant again and I wouldn't recommend it.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,D Jennings,28th April 2015,Allegiant Air forced my wife to pay twice for her bag or wouldn't let her on the flight. Returning from Vegas to Vancouver April 27th and had prepaid for carry-on bags. As we were boarding the gate agent said her standard size bag was too big it is the exact dimensions allowed on their website. She has used the same bag twice before and never an issue we also measured with a tape just to confirm before we left. The agent demanded US$50 additional for the check bag fee after already having paid US$25 for carry-on and then once she got her card charged let her take the bag on as carry-on and put it in the overhead bin same place it was on all other flights. We watched dozens of passengers with the same size or larger bag board without a word one had a stuffed duffle bag over 3' long double the allowable length not a word. We will never fly them again. Once you factor in all of the additional fees this discount airline is a total rip-off. Do yourself a favour and fly with a reputable airline not Allegiant Air.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,9,Marc Waldauer,26th April 2015,Syracuse to Fort Lauderdale 4/17/15. Fort Lauderdale to Syracuse 4/20/15. Both flights delayed about 40 minutes but was probably due to congestion on runway in fort Lauderdale which delayed arrival in Syracuse. Bought seats 3 months earlier because it was getting old having to drive to Buffalo to get a direct flight. Read their instructions carefully so we knew to check one large piece of luggage and 2 personal items to stow under seat. Paid for two seats in aisle's 10 (flight to Ft Lauderdale) two seats in aisle 11 on return flight. Also paid a little extra for my window seat. All add on fees are stated clearly when you book the flight. Since we booked 3 months in advance and it was not a special holiday weekend we got a good price. With travel insurance the total cost for 2 round trip tickets was $540. The planes may be older but the one we flew was recently refurbished. It is spartan and if the flight was longer my back and bad hip would have paid the price. The leg room is fine (I'm 5'6) and the seats are large enough. They could use a bit more cushioning so maybe next time I bring a cushion. The seats do not recline which is a negative unless the person in front of you would have caused a problem if he or she wanted to. The staff was friendly but you can only buy beverages (no coffee) or calorie galore little snacks (purchase by credit card only) for a modest cost. Bring on board your own food and the problem is solved. They deliver what they advertise. A modest cost direct flight. You won't get stuck with a connecting flight or have to drive to a city with a direct flight. There are no surprises if you read the material. Is a free carry on item cheaper when the total cost is higher. Obviously my opinion would be altered if the delays are endemic and since the planes are old I can imagine the frustration of sitting at an airport for hours awaiting a replacement to arrive. Other interesting titbits. They load the plane from front to back and they keep the boarding pass at the gate (so remember your seat assignment). I was pleased overall. If I want more comfort a different airline might be in order. After all Buffalo is a nice city to visit and fly in and out of (if the thruway is open).,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,Joetta Figg,23rd April 2015,Flight staff were standoffish. Flight 990 PGD-IND and flight 991 IND-PGD. The air was blowing in around the oxygen panel to the point that we had to be moved mid flight to another seat. Even though we were delayed 2 hours the sign at either airport never read anything but on time. The driver on the other end had no idea we were going to be two hours late. Had to board the plane from the stairs at the back of the plane! The plane was so cold coming home you could have kept meat frozen. The Air nozzle was broken and couldn't be turned off. Plane was full nothing could be done. I finally shoved a piece of paper in it to deflect the cold air. The captain spoke so fast that he couldn't be understood. Will I fly with them again - no.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,G McDonald,22nd April 2015,After reading some reviews I was a little sceptical seeing how this was my first time using Allegiant Air. The plane departed from Knoxville TN on time and landed in Orlando on time. I looked up bag information online before the flight and there were no surprises as some reviews had mentioned. There were snacks on the plane for sale and the staff was courteous and helpful. The seats on the plane were comfortable as an economy airplane seat can be expected. This is the perfect airline for anyone traveling light or just looking for the best price. Will definitely plan to use Allegiant again in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Deb Paris,19th April 2015,"Leaving Cedar Rapids Iowa going to Las Vegas. Plane issues forced a change of planes and a two hour delay. Airline changed the gate number at the last minute. As we pushed back from the gate I got a text message that the flight was delayed 1 hour. Why did they bother boarding us if there was a problem? We are told that because temp was 90 degrees it was too hot for this type of plane to take off. This is a common condition in Las Vegas. Why on earth does this company even have this type of plane here if it isn't suitable? We were then told that we must remain on the plane 20 minutes. If the plane can't take off why were we still on it? We are then told we were waiting for paperwork. Another ""plane delayed text"". After 2 hours and 10 minutes we were unloaded while a different plane was prepared. We were boarded onto an identical aircraft then we were told that the plane could indeed take off. After 7.5 hours we were finally in Iowa.",,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,M Record,19th April 2015,I set out to fly on Allegiant Air because I thought it would be a good deal and time saving since my family lived in Northern Maine and I live in Florida. First off I'd like to say that when you add up everything extra you have to pay for on this flight you really aren't saving that much. The plane I flew on was old and uncomfortable none of the seats would recline at all and the seat I paid extra for didn't have extra legroom compared to other airlines normal seating so I can't imagine how little room you got on the rest of the plane. During the flight you have to pay even for water. On my way back my flight was delayed 3 hours which is not enough alone to really upset me but when asked what was going to happen if they couldn't find a replacement plane they informed us that we would have to wait till tomorrow and absolutely refused to try and put us on other airline's flights nor did they even say they were sorry. As far as I'm concerned paying a little more is worth it to know that I'll fly on an airline that will get me to where I need to go!,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Marina Hadjisolomos,19th April 2015,We are frequent flyers in the US as well as Europe. Last time we travelled with Allegiant was horrible. The staff was rude we needed water and they didn't offer us any they seated us separately even though we booked our tickets months before and they had many empty seats to seat us together but they refused to. They also try to charge everyone for even 1 extra pound of luggage weight and they make you actually take a shoe off your suitcase and place it in your hand luggage to make the weight exact. They also tried to charge us for our carry on a normal size carry on that we take on every airline and never had any issue. Staff on the ground and on the plane were so rude. We will never fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,5,E Baba,14th April 2015,I've been flying Allegiant for years now between Ft. Lauderdale and Knoxville TN. No delays in the last year so I'm pleased (lucky!). The trip last week was my first on the different plane and I just hate the new seats. Hard and too straight my back was so achy I couldn't wait to arrive. I don't suffer back pains so I know the seats were the culprit. It's bad enough that they're so narrow but now they're like a board. It's not a long flight but must they make the ride so unpleasant? Don't they know how to make seats a little more comfortable?,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,3,Petersen Brandi,14th April 2015,"Flew from Honolulu Hawaii to Las Vegas last night on flight 1050 with 13 family members. Flight was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance. I understand things happen beyond the airlines control. After sitting in the airport for 5 hours we board and find out no complimentary anything - not even water. Again totally fine. But when I am paying full price for food and drinks and the flight attendant assisting is beyond disrespectful to not only me but other people on the flight making comments like ""didn't the snack cart just come around?"" to a guy who was in the bathroom and missed it. Was extremely disappointed in the customer service I thought they were just rude to me. When someone is paying for over priced food and drinks after sitting in the airport not knowing if we are even going to be able to fly today. At least show some customer service.",,,Economy Class,,,5,1,2,3,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,P Termaat,30th March 2015,Round trip flight to Clearwater FL. Both flights delayed over 3 hours. There was no apology no offer of a free beverage. At the flight end we were asked to align our seat belts and pick up other peoples trash. With all their up charges and fees our trip would have quicker and less expensive with a major airline with 1 stop. Not worth the hassle.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,K Horan,30th March 2015,"The flight from Grand Rapids to St. Pete's was our first and our last with Allegiant. On our way down to Florida our flight was delayed 3 hours with no explanation other than ""mechanical issues"". When we arrived at our gate there were two cases of (warm) pop and one case of (warm) water. When we asked the gate agent when the incoming plane would be arriving he told us 30 minutes. Much to everybody's surprise there was a plane at the gate 5 minutes later. Upon boarding the plane our flight attendants showed their true colors and lack of professionalism of Allegiant Airline. They made light of the life preserver located under the seat in the event that ""the flight turns into a cruise"". That is not only an extremely unprofessional comment but it certainly did not sit well with an already anxious flyer. For our returning trip we arrived two hours ahead of our scheduled departure as instructed. When we attempted to check our bag we were kicked out of line along with everyone else on our flight because Allegiant could not ""handle"" us at that time. We waited another half hour before being allowed to re-enter the line to check our single bag. We hoped that was the worst we would have to deal with that day but sadly we were wrong. After boarding the aircraft we proceeded to sit on it for an hour and a half with no idea what was going on. Finally we were told that we would have answers within the next 5 minutes as to what the situation was and we didn't. We deboarded the plane and sat in the airport for an additional 2 hours. When I asked the gate agent what was going on I was told they didn't know and there was nobody that I could speak with to find out. I will never fly Allegiant again. Although they may appear to offer customers a deal the headache they inflict is not worth it. I strongly urge anyone considering to fly with them to reconsider.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,G Fish,25th March 2015,We flew from Toledo OH to St Pete/Clearwater this past week. At both airports we were treated courteously and efficiently. We downloaded the Allegiant app and so downloaded our boarding passes for free and with no waste of paper. Perfect. Our flight was short so it didn't matter to us that the seats did not recline. In fact space was tight and reclining seats would have likely caused some conflict. The seats were comfortable but again I wasn't travelling far. We packed our own snacks (cheaper and much healthier) and brought our own drinks on board. No inflight entertainment but a small inconvenience given our cheap our flights were. Love that Allegiant flies into smaller airports as it makes the whole process easier. Very pleased overall and would book with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,James Voit,25th March 2015,My wife and I arrived two hours early to check in. Just before boarding time we were informed the flight was late. The flight was delayed three hours in good weather. After boarding and waiting to take off we accelerated down the run way and came to a screeching halt. The plane was not fit to fly and we were returned to the terminal. At this point it was mass confusion people were standing in lines with no instruction or guidance. We finally managed to get our luggage back but unable to contact Allegiant about anything else.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,Ben Bartlett,18th March 2015,There is a reason they only offer flights that no one else does. They have more hidden fees than any airline I have ever used by about triple. You pay outrageous bag fees fees to choose a seat fees for in-flight snacks fees for boarding passes fees for a carry on. Make sure you don't take full size luggage or anything but clothing or you will be over the weight limit. Overall flying with Allegiant was the worst flight experience of my life. No inflight entertainment or even the option to purchase it.,,,Business Class,,,2,3,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,6,J Vander Meulen,17th March 2015,It is worth booking with Allegiant only if you book early for the best possible deal and do your homework. I did not do the former but was glad I did the latter (which if you're reading this you are also doing.) Pack light or the charges add up. Bring food and fill a beverage container after security or the charges add up. Print your boarding pass before heading to the airport yup more charges. Finally keep your expectations in check. This airline is a means from A to B not a 'travel experience' on which to build memories. There's no in-flight entertainment or free food. Best for relatively short trips that do not require frequent washroom use. Oh and contrary to many reviews here I found the crew to be attentive good-natured and even humorous.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,10,Jamie Jacobs,17th March 2015,We just flew out of Niagara Falls. We are Canadian and saved a lot of money by driving the extra hour or so our only snag was an ice storm we had to drive through. Long story short we sat in the airport all night waiting for our flight to arrive from Sandford after they couldn't land because of poor weather conditions we were all shipped to a local hotel where we stayed at no charge. The next morning we were all given an $8 food voucher and a $100 credit. The airport was small the people were friendly especially the flight attendants to and from Sandford! I will definitely be flying with Allegiant Air again!,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,5,1,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Hector Martinez,17th March 2015,On March 5th we traveled to Las Vegas. Assigned separate seats even though we bought tickets together - not good. Accept credit card only to purchase items onboard - not good. On the way back from Las Vegas to McAllen we encountered weather problems and had to land in Laredo. We land in Laredo and were told we had to stay in Laredo overnight due to bad weather. Allegiant did not provide nor offered any assistance. If we wanted to drive back to McAllen it would be at our own expense.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,2,,,no
Allegiant Air,,Janice Green,17th March 2015,We have flown with Allegiant before and found it not too bad. We recently flew to Sanford FL February 28 to March 10 and I have to say I will think long and hard before flying with them again. I can understand charging for seat changes if they put you at the back and you want to be at the front - but when you book as a couple and want to fly as a couple (husband and wife - same last names) and they don't even sit you together - I have issues. They put you all over the plane so you have to pay the extra fee to sit together. There was a vacant seat beside my husband on the flight. Also you have to pay for boarding passes now. I have to say the flights are not filled like they use to be and I can see why.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Lynn Robbins,17th March 2015,My sister-in-law flew back to Plattsburgh from Punta Gorda on Allegiant after a week-long visit. The first thing she said when she called after arriving in Plattsburgh was that the airplane was filthy. There were crumbs on her seat and the bathroom smelt awful and was dirty. A totally terrible experience especially after paying over $400 for her ticket and an additional $20 for a carryon that she was told was too big for the overhead. Never a problem on other airlines.

Allegiant Air,,E Paul,17th March 2015,I booked a flight to Ft Lauderdale to visit family from Feb 23 to March. I only booked the flight due to lower costs and non stop flight. Sadly the service was not good. It took almost 2 hours to leave Syracuse airport. This was not due to any weather issues. Not sure what the reason was? Service on the flight was terrible and individuals were young and unprofessional. Return flight we waited at Ft Lauderdale for over 2 hours to have the flight cancelled due to inexperienced pilots wrong scheduling? What? They were rude and the pilots that were scheduled were rude as well. They were joking and laughing about incident. The gate employees told us to go to the ticket counter for a hotel voucher. However no rental food or shuttle vouchers! The refund for the cancel was $100 per ticket. We waited in line for an hour before anyone showed up.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no

Allegiant Air,,Chad Bailey,9th March 2015,"Our first time trying Allegiant and our last. The aircraft itself had to be older than me - and I'm 37. Then there were issues with the gate agents ""miscounting"" the number of individuals on the plane. They made several passes through the cabin and came up with a different number each time. Next comes the maintenance issues and delays. We were initially delayed because of maintenance issues on the aircraft. Something to do with the de- icing system and another to do with the fuel calculations? Which made no sense. We were initially delayed for an hour that turned to 1.5 hrs after we need to wait on updated flight documents to make its way back to the plane. The flight itself -- I've never been more tense on a flight than this one. I could go on about the nickel and diming - baggage fees (and then more of an up charge if you do it at the airport) baggage weight limits below industry standard fee to print a boarding pass charges for any drink or snack on the plane etc. I'm surprised we didn't need to swipe our credit card to use the restroom on the plane!

Allegiant Air,1,Gavin Inglis,9th March 2015,To say that this is an economy airline does not really label the airline properly. This is amateur hour. I am sure that they have some terrific flight attendants. I sadly did not get to meet any of them. Be warned none of the seats in the plane recline. Like many airlines now they charge for bags. Unlike any airlines that I know they limit the weight to 40 lbs. not 50 lbs. If a bag is 41 lbs. they charge for a full extra bag (if you have a 41 lbs. bag it costs $100). They charge for water. Our flight was delayed because they had not calculated the fuel requirement correctly and had to send 4 flight attendants and 2 ground crew up and down the aisle again and again counting the passengers. Unlike any other airline I have used one is required to turn all electronic devices off. Airplane mode is not acceptable. Unlike any other airline that I have used no one is allowed to use any form of electronic device during take off and landings. While that was common place 10 years ago that has been proven to be unnecessary on every other airline. The planes are old and well worn. I had never used Allegiant before this past weekend and will never use them again. I did not save that much money to make it worth while. Extremely disappointed.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no

Allegiant Air,,A Kincaid,4th March 2015,Feb 20 2015 from Punta Gorda Fl. to South Bend IN. I have emphysema and spinal stenosis and need a wheelchair to get through security and to the plane. I can walk certain distances but not as far as through airports and to planes. My friends drove me to the airport but had to get a wheelchair for me because they had no one to do it for me. Then they did not have anyone to push me through security and to the gate so my friend had to get a pass to push me through all that. At the gate an older man with a cane came over beside me and there were some wheelchairs sitting there so he got one to sit in and asked me if I knew why there was no help for us. Usually handicapped people are boarded first along with people with children and first class passengers. This did not happen with Allegiant Air. They boarded a long line of what seemed to be a lot of first class passengers and I don't know who else before the actually asked the older gentlemen if we needed help to the plane. They finally pushed us to the plane. My assigned seat was in the second row so I don't know where the so-called first class people were sitting. The biggest insult came after landing in South Bend IN. They announced that people waiting for wheelchairs were to remain on the plane until all other passengers were gone. I was surprised to see several wheelchairs sitting just outside the plane door but no people to push them. Finally someone came and pushed me into the airport. Another point against Allegiant Air is when I tried to print my boarding pass it wouldn't let me. This is usually because I have to carry a POC (oxygen concentrator) to use on board. I printed the page telling me this because they charge $5.00 if your boarding pass has to be printed at the airport. Foolishly I thought since I showed them I couldn't print my boarding pass they wouldn't charge me $5.00 but they did without telling me. It just showed up on my credit card. The two women at the ticket counter were unfriendly and at times downright rude. The attitude was this is the way it is so take it or leave it.

Allegiant Air,7,W McLaughlin,24th February 2015,February 20/15. Just returned home from a RT flight and package from Niagara to Fort Myers. I had read a lot of reviews regarding this airlines. It made me nervous. But our experience was great. If you do your homework before hand you won't be surprised with a lot of extras and confusion. I would definitely fly this airline again. They were slightly late returning home (20 min). This was it unusual for any other airlines we have flown. The luggage arrived on the carousel quickly and without incident. The check in at Niagara was quick and easy. The same couldn't be said about Punta Gourda. We were there in plenty of time but soon became fearful of missing our flight. We didn't but it was close. Both check-in and security were backed up severely. The staff on the plane were great. There was a medical emergency on the plane and they handled it well and kept their cool. All in all the whole experience was every bit as good as any Air Canada flight I've been on. Only complaint would be that they charge for water. Took my own on the returning flight!,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,3,Eastman Forest,24th February 2015,We flew Cedar Rapids IA. to Mesa AZ. Flight was only 15 min. late. Seating very cramped and uncomfortable. No problems with personnel.. We had to change reservations. Went online and were given a number to call. Waited 45 min. to get to talk to anyone. No problem once we got through. We had to cancel our return trip. Again waited 45 minutes to talk to anyone. We cancelled two months before scheduled flight and was told we could only receive a voucher for another flight. The voucher was good for 12 months but they dated it from Aug. 2014 . The flight was for April 2015. This made the voucher useless to us. All in all the lower fare was not worth the hassle.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,1,,,3,no

Allegiant Air,1,R Gundy,18th February 2015,Wont ever fly them again! Cheap is cheap you get nothing comfortable or convenient. All I can say good is we got from point A to point B. They charged us 50$ for a bag that was 46 pounds (most airlines that's within the 50# allotted). They are rude. No snacks nor pop are free even after delayed twice. Seats have no room and plane is cramped badly. Very uncomfortable flight. We sat waiting to even pull away from where we board for 40 minutes before getting out to taxi down runway. I would pay the little extra and fly a better airline any day!,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,5,Cindy Howell,18th February 2015,"This airline has an affordable price. But it needs improvements in some areas. Pros: good price non-stop extras are not built into the price you have a choice what you want to pay for (seats beverages food priority check- in baggage options). Cons: I purchased ""trip flex"". Could not change my flight online. Needed to call a rep. Waited 1/2 hr for a rep and took approx 1/2 hr. to get one leg of my trip changed. Very slow. When I got to the airport nowhere was flight info. posted. I had printed off my boarding pass and did not want to stand in line to find out what gate to go to. Had to ask a baggage person who was unsure and he found another employee and finally got my answer. Got to where I was hoping my gate was to find no agent. Other people were sitting around in confusion as well ""hoping"" they were at the right gate. Still no flight info on the screen. Had checked my flight status before leaving which posted ""on time"" and after asking other passengers (still no agent) found out that the flight was delayed 2.5 hrs.

Allegiant Air,,L Danyluk,11th February 2015,Besides the nickel and dime the others mention: for flight from Rockford IL to Orlando. Got there 2 hrs early as instructed. At departure time 6.43pm our plane was still on the ground in Orlando (no reason why was given). We waited for the plane to fly here. Almost like 2 uncomfortable flights for one! Got to car rental at 2am Orlando time - our car was given away. Coming home the flight was on time and 3 minutes shaved off of flight time 2.5 hours. After landing picture the plane noses right up to the wall of the terminal we deplane go to baggage area in front of plane on other side of that wall. They took over one hour to move the bags through the opening to us about 150 ft. total. Temps were 20's but no snow. Never again. Their contempt for passengers is too high. It took almost one hour before they said bags will be delayed!,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,1,,2,no
Allegiant Air,10,K Cole,11th February 2015,"We had a wonderful experience despite being worried about the bad reviews. 2 adults and 4 children and probably would not have taken this trip were it not for the ""unbundling"" Allegiant does that allowed us to fly people to Florida at only $130 each RT! We definitely ""unbundled by printing boarding passes at home and then at the hotel (savings: $60) and by packing light (4 carry-ons and 6 personal items (backpacks between us. We also flew with children over the age of 11 and chose not to board early (savings) and not to guarantee seats together. Another big savings even though Allegiant did book us all together on one flight and 3 and 3 on the way to Florida so it was not as if we were scattered all over the plane. We brought our own snacks on board (savings!) and we were able to go directly to the gate. The gate agents did not quibble about the size of the kids backpacks which were technically a bit over the size restrictions but we were processed right through happily. The stuffed toys they won in the theme parks their blankets and their food/snacks were allowed on with no problems. Our flight to Florida was right on time and the service was very friendly. We were even allowed to move seats to find window seats for the kids!! On the return we flew just a day after a massive snowstorm in the NE with multiple cancellations and yet our flight had only a 1 hour and 15 minute delay. During the delay I was astonished to see Allegiant set up a ""drink station"" with cups ice an ice scooper and free water and several kinds of sodas in the waiting area at Sanford/Orlando. Considering this was a weather related and very short delay we were amazed by that gesture. Yes you might be ""nickle and dimed"" but only if you feel you must purchase the 'extras' like leg room or extra bags or snacks or if you need someone to print out your boarding pass for you. If you want to have that service great! But for those of us who don't need that service and would rather spend our money at the theme parks on our children - Allegiant is a wonderful option. The flight attendants and gate agents were friendly and the customer service on the phone was top-notch. We will be flying this airline again.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,10,S Callas,6th February 2015,Very pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again. I went out of Concord NC to St. Petersburg FL. I traveled with my cat. Unfortunately my cat screamed the entire flight (something that was I was not expecting). However the flight attendants were very understanding. The seats were comfortable. There was plenty of room under the seat for my pet carrier. I did not order any drinks. However the drink selections looked more than adequate and the prices were comparable to other airlines. This was a short flight (1 hour).,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,3,Tom More,6th February 2015,We travelled to Phoenix on January 19th and returned on the 26th. We are very upset by all the extra charges. They offer cheaper rates but then add on $75 for one piece of luggage $25 for a carry-on $18 to select a seat plus all the taxes. Why don't they just make it a one fee and include everything? The airline does not offer free (or any) coffee tea or even just a glass of water. You must purchase everything else you want to drink. Where is their customer service?,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,1,,2,no
Allegiant Air,2,Mihaela G Tofan,6th February 2015,Flying with Allegiant used to be a great experience but not anymore. I recently went to Las Vegas from Des Moines Iowa and the plane had a problem and we had to spend 2 hours in the uncomfortable seats before takeoff. Nobody bothered to offer us water or anything. After 4 hours of being in the plane we got to the destinations. We didn't have too much luck on the way back to Des Moines I was charged 50$ for a 8 pound carry on because their site will not work properly so I couldn't add it online for 18$ fee. They're ridiculously charging for choosing the seat boarding pass carry on and water and soon for the oxygen that we're going to breathe on the plane. I'm really upset because it's such a disappointment to travel with them these days. I hope they will get better.,,,Economy Class,,,,2,1,1,,2,no

After boarding aircraft waited on tarmac for 45 minutes. Back to gate. Stated we could get off and sit in jetway but could not go into terminal. Waited for an on call mechanic another 1.5 hr wait. Plane fixed. Off to Orlando 4 hours late. The return trip no email that flight was late. Get to airport 2 hours early. We have a plane and no crew. Waited for crew to be called in to work. They arrive and now no pilots. Told we will have a pilot from incoming flight that is now 3 hours late. Crew very rude when boarding. Return flight also 4 hours late.

Allegiant Air,8,S Delmaire,28th January 2015,Flew from Minot to Phoenix and back on the weekend. The price was right and there were no surprises with luggage costs we read everything online before we left. The staff was very helpful and extremely polite. All flights departed and arrived on time with no delays. Our luggage was unloaded quickly and we were on our way in no time. I would definitely fly with Allegiant again!,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,4,D Cowan,28th January 2015,"When I first started flying from PHX to BIL on Allegiant about four years ago I was thrilled large plane direct flight great prices. Even though I had to drive 2 hours to get to Phoenix from Tucson it was worth it. I told everyone about this great little airline. Well that great little airline seems to be suffering from growing pains. In other words they've gotten too big for their britches. They're charging prices like the big carriers (in spite of the fact that fuel prices are half of what they were a year ago) but not offering the same service. They nickel-and-dime you to death: $5 to print your boarding pass for you? $50 for an overweight bag (down to 40 lbs. allowable - it used to be 50 lbs.). Having to purchase water? Paying for seat assignment and checked and carry-on bags? What's next pay toilets on the plane? The worst part is trying to call their ""customer service"" number. I needed to change my reservation but wasn't allowed to do so using their website. While I waited on hold for 35 minutes to find out what the additional fare would be I had to listen to a recording continually telling me that I should be using their website instead. On the up side both my flights were actually on time for a change. Allegiant seems to want to charge large carrier prices without providing large carrier service (which isn't exactly anything to rave about either). If they want to sit at the grown-ups table they better learn to put their napkin in their lap instead of tucking it under their chin. Speaking of napkins I wonder when they'll start charging for those too?",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,1,,2,no
Allegiant Air,9,Rick Eaton,26th January 2015,Flew 1/22/15 from AVL to PIE on time no issues. Last 10 flights have been on time. Remember several things: 1) Check in online at least 1 hour in advance or it costs you $5 per adult2) luggage weight limit is 40lbs or they charge you 3) every flight we have flown has been packed. This is a no frill airline that's adds costs for everything. They fly into small airports not the big ones. Know and follow the rules or it will cost you $.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,,5,yes

Allegiant Air,1,Iweka Janine,23rd January 2015,Nickle and dimed! We were trying to fly from PA to FL on the cheap so we went with Allegiant. Big mistake. The base fare may seem inexpensive but they charge extra for everything (carry-on +$30 pick your seat another +$30 drinks snacks $5 etc.). The flight attendants were cranky and rude! My husband is tall and he has a bad knee so we paid $32 extra to reserve his seat in the emergency exit row (more legroom). I was led to believe that I would be seated next to him if possible. Not so. I checked-in on-line exactly 24 hours before the flight and was seated on the opposite end of the plane. Just before take-off we noticed that the seat next to him was empty. I politely asked the flight attendant if I could sit next to my husband and she rudely barked that I could not sit there as it was an exit row and I hadn't paid an extra $30 to sit there. I quietly returned to my assigned seat. If you're thinking of flying with this airline just be sure to calculate what you're actually spending (after baggage fees picking seat fees printing boarding passes fees getting a drink of water mid-flight fees etc.) and be sure to factor in dismal customer service as well.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,J Myer,23rd January 2015,"Got evicted from my seat for being ""too attached to my grandchildren"". My husband and I took our family - 9 adults 4 children 2 infants-to Hawaii. We paid extra for the better seats for all of us and also for two exit row seats for my husband and myself. We were very pleased with the seats and the legroom for the price we paid. However While waiting an hour on the tarmac for the plane to take off I and many of the other passengers used that time to get up and stretch our legs. I talked to my family and helped entertain the grandkids. Upon returning to my seat the flight attendant told me that I had lost my chance to be in the exit row because I was ""too attached to my grandchildren"". I was incredulous but she was very firm. I had to switch seats with my son for the entire flight to Hawaii. So beware - if you are in the exit row - don't act like you like children.",,,Economy Class,,,5,1,,,,5,no
Allegiant Air,,N Perrine,19th January 2015,My husband and I traveled from Rockford IL to Las Vegas December 11-14 2014. The flight December 11 was first delayed due to a maintenance issue. After arriving to the airport we found out the flight was totally cancelled. We were told that our flight was rescheduled for noon on Friday the 12th. We finally departed at 12:35 December 12th. This caused us to miss nearly an entire day of our short trip. On the way back Sunday December 14th our flight was again delayed due to a maintenance issue. We were asked to switch gates and wait for another plane to arrive. We finally headed home 3 hours after our scheduled flight. We have made this trip 4 times in the last 8 years and only 2 of those trips were acceptable. The last time we had a significant issue (once again missing our first night in Vegas due to maintenance issues in the plane we were flying in and having to make an urgent landing in Colorado to wait for another plane) Allegient was willing to offer a travel voucher to us.

Allegiant Air,1,Edward Hall,19th January 2015,I have flown from South Bend Indiana to and from Punta Gorda Florida several times on Allegiant each time I ask myself why? Well after today no more. They had 4 flights scheduled from Punta Gorda this morning but only 3 ticket agents on hand. As a result we waited in line for 1.5 hours to get on the plane only to be told by the boarding stewardess to hurry as they wanted to leave on time and that we should have got there earlier.

Allegiant Air,2,E English,19th January 2015,I fly a lot and when I heard Allegiant was coming to Indianapolis I was very excited. That changed quickly. Be prepared for the following fees on top of the airfare: Between $15-$30 to choose your seat. That's each way not round trip. If you are flying with a family there is an extra $100 easy. $15 each way for a carry on bag. You can only bring a lap top bag for free. $15 to use a credit card when checking out. $50 for a checked bag. Online booking fee. $5 to print boarding pass if you do at the airport. All in all it was about $60 cheaper than Southwest for me to get to Tampa from IND. If they just rolled all those fees into the total price I would be happy. But they make you first decline a hotel rental car attractions trip protection. Then you have to go page by page with the fees. By the time I got hit with a $15 credit card fee I was exhausted. Also no place to put your Known Traveler Number. Be ready to wait on hold for over 30min for that. I'm afraid if I do it at the airport they will charge me another $10!,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,2,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,Ingeborg Jakobson,19th January 2015,The flight crew would not give me a cup of water to drink on a flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles. All food and beverages even water was for additional purchase. The seats were extremely uncomfortable and my lower back hurt me a great deal. It was the worst flight I have ever endured. It took almost 30 minutes for baggage to arrive to the carrousel and the arrival gate was very far from our connecting flight which we almost missed!

Finally after flying home and being unable to land we flew to Las Vegas. It took another hour and 3 lines later to get a room. I could have drove home and to Disneyland twice in the time it took to fly with them. Actually I would have drove home if they would have been honest at first rather than keep delaying.

Seats are plastic with minimal padding I don't mind the non-reclining but 2-3 hours on a plastic kitchen chair is uncomfortable at best realistically it was painful. Five flights leaving PIE on the 3rd of Jan all delayed at least an hour. Five flights of people in a four gate terminal. There weren't enough seats the snack bar ran out of food and TSA was a joke. Check-in was a circus with the clerks culling certain flights to check in first. Not because of time they just chose to do it.

Finally some Allegiant airport staff show up and inform the waiting passengers that a plane is being flown in from Las Vegas. 1 hour after our original departure time the plane arrives. Passengers get first text from Allegiant that the flight has been delayed. No kidding? Another hour passes and we're told of another hour delay because ""The kitchen needs stocking"".

Allegiant Air,3,J Clonts,11th January 2015,I use Allegiant because they fly to some smaller airports at very competitive rates (Sanford Roanoke). On Christmas eve last week I boarded the 1st plane for an hour before a maintenance issue came up and we deboarded. 2 hours later we board a second plane which flew for about an hour before returning to Sanford. This is probably because Allegiant flies the oldest fleet in the country. We were told another plane would be there by midnight (13.5 hours in Sanford airport). So I missed Christmas with my family. But they did give us $8 for food all day which doesn't cover the cost of the cheapest burger available and a $100 voucher which I had to call twice to use. I guess this is what comes with being the lowest cost ticket.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,T Empie,11th January 2015,My flight was from tri-cities airport to St. Petersburg/Clearwater on Friday January 2nd. My husband and I received a call 1 day before our flight telling us that our flight had been moved from 10am Friday morning to 11.59pm Friday night. This means we will be in town another full day and both will be missing work. Not only that but our flight was delayed 3 and a half additional hours. So now we will not be taking off until at least 3.15am. This would put my husband and I getting home around 6am. No voucher or compensation was offered.

Allegiant Air,1,Brandon Knudson,11th January 2015,"My flight from MOT to LAS (447) scheduled for 1/2/15 for 6.20pm. After 3 delays we got word that our plane had finally arrived. Instead of pulling into the airport terminal it went to the Fedex hanger. Of coarse they had to have the crew go pull them out by the time they offloaded the crew had reached it's ""time"" for the day but if they hadn't been delayed 3 times and then parked at a Fedex building instead of the terminal then they wouldn't have run out of ""time"". So 5 hours waiting at the airport were a waste and instead of just cancelling the flight right away we were not honestly communicated with. We were informed that night that the flight would be 9.30 am. After arriving to the airport I get a call and email saying the flight had been rescheduled for 1.15. So after I return again to the airport the flight is delayed but this time no warning or communication. Just time to board comes and goes. An update came at 2.30 that they were having troubles with the plane and that they would have it fixed momentarily and be on there way. At 4 they told us they were all clear that once the flight crew gave the go ahead then we would begin boarding. At 6.30pm they told us the plane wasn't going to be able to fly. They then told us that in 2 hours a new plane would be coming from Fargo to pick us up. So it is now 7.39 and I have been here in the terminal with no food or drink waiting for some honesty and communication from Allegiant.

Allegiant Air,9,S Constance,5th January 2015,"If you carefully read the website while booking your flights and know and understand exactly what extra fees might apply to you then it's an incredible value. This is truly a ""no frills"" airline. Old generally uncomfortable airplanes but efficient and cordial staff and competent pilots flying out of small airports. I flew Niagara/Buffalo to Sanford and both flights arrived relatively on time (one flight was 15 minutes late due to a handicapped passenger trying to get to and into their seat which is nobody's fault). I paid for my carry on beforehand and while their carry-on sizing is on the small side I was eventually able to fit mine into the sizing holster and be on my way. It was an easy 1hr 20 minute drive to Niagara/Buffalo airport from the east side of Toronto. Parking at Niagara airport is almost like mall parking. Find your spot and you'll be at most a 3 minute walk from your car to the departure desk. I'd downloaded my ticket to my phone so no fee for that and was at the gate with plenty of time to spare. The other benefit was rental car pickup at Sanford is literally a one minute walk out the front door of the terminal. No shuttle/bus to get to rental cars like Orlando Int'l Airport and others. I paid $220 round trip including my carry on baggage fee. The same flight with Air Canada Rouge out of Toronto would have been $600 and for sure would have been a far inferior experience both at the airport and from a service perspective. To put it into perspective a 25 minute taxi ride to get from Toronto to my house is $80 each way. So for $60 more I flew to Florida. Again if you go in knowing that this is total no frills no free entertainment no free food/drinks and you just want to get from A to B in as inexpensive and efficient a manner as possible then I'd have no hesitations recommending Allegiant to anyone. It's rare these days to be pleasantly surprised by an airline experience. Kudos to Allegiant and associated small-time airports.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,3,Claude Blackburn,5th January 2015,I've flown Allegiant many times and always from Bellingham to Palm Springs Palm Springs-Bellingham. The only reason we take Allegiant is because we live near Bellingham and Palm Springs and they have direct flights. The seats don't recline and couldn't be much closer and they charge extra for everything. But today on the flight from KBLI to KPSP was really miserable the plane left an hour late but worse because the floor and my feet were freezing the entire time we sat on the tarmac and during the entire 2.5 hour flight. I would definitely bring winter gear next time I fly Allegiant in the winter.

Sure there were incidents in the past but because we thought we were getting a ""deal"" on everything we let it pass. Found out when we were at the airport that another major airline now also offers service to Las Vegas that when compared to Allegiant for price and service wins hands down. When we went back to Vegas in Oct I decided to book my hotel car and shuttle separately and then booked our flight with this other airline. Then just to compare I booked the same package deal through Allegiant to compare prices and this is how it turned out. Flight with other airline +$64 booked hotel through hotel website -$120 booked car through car website -$28 booked shuttle upon arrival in Vegas -$4 in total I saved $88 on a package deal where I thought it was the best deal. $88 plus the unsatisfactory service and on time arrival and depatarture record is huge to me.",,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,Glen Hyden,31st December 2014,Booked a RT for my family for a Christmas vacation from Tulsa to Sanford and this was our first trip on Allegiant. Departed right on time on a MD-80 with a refurbished and comfortable interior. As a frequent traveler who rarely reclines a seat in other planes in consideration of the passenger behind me I was relieved that these seats were not reclined seats so the passenger in front would not infringe on my space. Flight crew was friendly and professional. Return trip was 2 hrs late departing but I got a text message 7 hrs in advance and I adjusted our schedule accordingly and all was well. Return flight was on an A320 in great shape and the crew was friendly and professional. We liked the approach of paying for only the extras you want and the web site was very clear about this so we don't understand why anyone is surprised and can't comprehend the pricing model. Allegiant Air is a good product fairly priced and we will certainly be repeat customers.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,2,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,9,M Heyser,22nd December 2014,I flew from Hagerstown to Sanford and back five days apart. I found everyone in both terminals to be very cordial. The boarding agent in Hagerstown was actually humorous and made the wait seem shorter. The flight attendants were not exactly warm but they were nevertheless efficient. Both flights left and arrived on time. I have read complaints about luggage fees but I think the website is quite clear so I decided to travel light. I had a small bag as my one small free carry-on item and I thought that I might have to pay a fee for the dozen roses in my other hand but there was no extra charge. No problems on my first flight using Allegiant. I'll do it again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,3,C Milford,22nd December 2014,Our trip was from Ft. Wayne IN to Tampa Fl. Allegiant made us believe that we would be flying into the Tampa International Airport we actually flew into the Clearwater/St. Pete Airport. We made arrangements to rent a car at the airport but because the car was not at the airport we landed we had to pay ($35) for transportation to the Tampa International Airport to get to the car. On the return home we had to return the car to Tampa International Airport and pay ($40) for transportation to get to the Clearwater/St Pete Airport to our flight home. The people at the car rental office says this happens all the time because of Allegiant Air's miscommunication! We got a great deal on our airline tickets but we had to spend so much extra on the car that we'll certainly think twice before using Allegiant Air again!,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,,Gary DeHaas,18th December 2014,Took a flight from Provo Ut. to L.A. the flight was delayed 3 hours on the flight out and 2 hours on the flight back. I will not fly this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,9,J Allen,18th December 2014,Ft Lauderdale FL to Greenville SC. 12/04/14. Flight on time. Clean aircraft. Pleasant flight attendants. Have flown Allegiant many times and have never had any problems.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,7,A Bjorndalen,10th December 2014,Booked several weeks in advance for a trip from Minot ND to Las Vegas. We paid for advanced seat selection and a checked luggage item at the time of booking. The Allegiant website and online check-in app were incredibly easy and intuitive. I did have difficulty getting the boarding pass to load with the app at first but a couple of tries later it worked. The check in agent in Minot wore a Frontier Airlines uniform and generally was kind of ignorant. The Minot terminal was very cold. The flight was delayed briefly for an issue with an inbound passenger but eventually left about 20 minutes late. Flight was uneventful and went by quickly. I found the MD-83 to be actually quite comfortable even though the seats didn't recline. There was no inflight entertainment system but the onboard magazine was decent and even contained Vegas coupons! We arrived only a little late. The crew was efficient and friendly and even cracked a couple jokes over the PA on arrival and bags dispensed quickly. On the return flight check-in and boarding were pleasant and quick and we left on time. The airplane however was absolutely filthy! The seats were worn the tray tables were slopped all over and even the window had food on it. We had the same crew situation as outbound in that they were efficient friendly and helpful. On arrival to Minot we were early but luggage took 30 minutes to dispense. In the end yes this airline is acceptable. They're certainly inexpensive and the crews are on par with most other carriers. If you want to save up to a few hundred dollars I'm sure you can put up with buying your soda onboard.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,D Vines,4th December 2014,Flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas on November 17th 2014. My first and last Allegiant trip. 6 hour delay in Bellingham arriving in Vegas after midnight and losing our first evening on a short break. They gave us a $8 meal voucher which bought half a burger at the only restaurant in Bellingham air side. What looked like a cheap fare was not so good after adding $30 to select a seat $26 to take a carry on bag and another $26 for a carrier usage fee. When the plane did finally take off it was freezing cold they charge for everything on board and didn't even have hot drinks available. Consumer loyalty needs to be earned from delivering service above and beyond customers expectations.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,no
Allegiant Air,,K Kinney,4th December 2014,Punta Gorda from Columbus Ohio. They charge for a carry on. You are allowed to carry on one personal item for no cost so just a purse if you are a woman. Then you pay for your checked bag. If you can't or don't pay ahead of time for your bag it's $50 at the airport! I tried to add a bag after I checked in and I couldn't unless I paid the $50 at the airport. $5 if you don't print your boarding pass yourself and all drinks and food are extra on the plane. When I boarded the plane it was very old. The seats had no padding and they don't recline. Customer service is a joke and by the time you pay all the little fees you can fly Southwest cheaper. I will never fly with Allegiant again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,3,Willingham Cathy,1st December 2014,Flight 105 on Nov 10th from Peoria to Phoenix/Mesa. I was recently on a flight from Peoria IL. to Mesa AZ. The fasten seat belt sign was on for over two hours even though the flight was mostly smooth and little turbulence. An elderly gentleman got up to use the restroom and was told to return to his seat. The flight attendant was very rude with a control complex. I have never been on a flight where people were not allowed to get up and use the restroom.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,2,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,8,R Chaudhry,1st December 2014,This airline is based on everything being a la carte. You pay for your ticket your seats (yes even seats) your drinks and your baggage and yet the whole experience turned out to be better than many other airlines. For one this airline made it possible for me to take my whole family along because of the low rates. Secondly the staff was super nice. There is only one class in their aircraft's and everyone gets the same service. Bucket leather seats are pretty comfortable even though they don't recline. There is no inflight entertainment but then again with all the carry-on gadgets today who needs another console in your face? I am giving inflight entertainment five stars because I actually enjoyed not having another console blasting ads in my face.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,5,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,8,Greg Howard,20th November 2014,I've flown Allegiant Air 10 times in the last 2 years. I normally fly out of Sanford Fl to Bangor Harrisburg or Youngstown. The problem I and my wife have is each time we fly into or out of Youngstown. They are very unorganized and always cause a problem. On Sunday Nov 9 2014 I was told that my carry on bag was too large and I had to pay an additional $50.00. I had already paid $12.00 for the carry on. They said that is not their problem. They also charged me $5.00 to print a boarding pass. I only have problems in Youngstown.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,9,C Kurtz,20th November 2014,I flew to CVG and back to Punta Gorda and have no complaints I received excellent service. The flights took and landed on time. I had my dog with me on the return flight and there were no issues there either. The plane was clean crew was nice - how could I complain about a reasonably priced direct flight? I suppose if you need frills and pampering maybe this is not your cup of tea but for easy going people who want to get where they are going for an excellent price check them out.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,J Dunn,17th November 2014,Flew Nov 7 2014. Tried to check in online and print ticket but it would not allow me to do so. Got to airport to check-in and had to pay $5.00 for my printed ticket. I also paid $30.00 to have my seat selection that I wanted. Allegiant Air did not show up instead Falcon Air was flying us from Pasco WA to Mesa AZ. Was told that they were not going to allow anyone to use prepaid selected seats. Just open seating. Not happy when we arrived I went to Allegiant counter to ask for a refund. They were extremely rude and said not their problem and suggested that I talk to corporate. I asked for a phone number then was told they don't have phone numbers to give out. Flight home was the exact same as flight down. Where is Allegiant Air and why are they booking flights and charging for seats that they don't offer.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,A Gipe,31st October 2014,10/25/14 flight 581 from Bellingham to Las Vegas and on 10/26/14 flight 580 from Las Vegas to Bellingham. The trip down on flight 581 was severely delayed. Taxied down the runway only to have to come back to the gate when a warning light on the navigation system came on just before take off. At the gate 20+ minutes later they thought they had it all sorted out and were wrapping up paperwork went to push back from the gate and the light came on again. Thankfully after a few more minutes they let us off the plane and kept us in the terminal. Flight eventually was given permission to travel without the navigation systems but had to redirect flight path and had to fly at a lower altitude to avoid traffic. This crew was friendly and polite and the pilot kept us informed of all the things that were happening. The major downfall our flight landed almost 4 hours later than scheduled and the only compensation we received was a free $2.00 beverage. Flight 580 the next day was better in some ways worse in others. Again taxied down the runway and were next to take off when a warning light came on. We sat on the runway for about 30 minutes waiting for the issue to be fixed. Sadly the crew was very rude both in person and on the intercom barking orders and coming dangerously close to a yelling tone with passengers. This was not my first poor trip with Allegiant but it will be the last. The low ticket price is no longer a selling feature since they gouge you on fees for everything including printing a simple boarding pass. Driving to SeaTac Airport is about the same cost when you add in all Allegiant's fees but comes with the added peace of mind when it comes to mechanical soundness and pleasant staff.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,D Lindahl,28th October 2014,We have a limited access to a variety of airlines as we live in a rural area and have relied on Allegiant the majority of time as their airport is closest. We will now be not using them as we ran into a delay again when coming back from Vegas. Felt bad for the counter personal as no one could check in due to technology problems - large group of people standing in line for over an hour. Finally got on plane and took off at 7.45am. No coffee blankets or pillows on plane. We sat in the front row and got to listen to the staff talk about their personal issues the whole flight. Very unprofessional and my thought was what an easy job sitting down with an occasional walk thru giving orders to tired customers otherwise just sitting! We know it's a low cost airline but common courtesy doesn't cost anything. The delay was the second time it had happened using this airline and they will not be given a chance to do it a third time! Will not recommend this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,10,Echeban Philpot,28th October 2014,10/12 CKB-SFB flight 670. 10/19 SFB-CKB flight 669. I recommend Allegiant Air. Fly non-stop no frills low cost comfortable on time no hassle. At small airports spend less than 20 min from landing to your car and 60 min from arrival to departure is enough. Newly refurbished MD80-great plane. I am 5ft 10 and had at least 4-5 inch free space in front of my knees. Charging $26 for carry-on is good so people pay $40 for 40 lb / 81 in checked bag and the overhead bins are empty to put the allowed personal item. Room under the seat in front of you is big. Seats do not recline-big deal! Allegiant is low cost with egalitarian all-coach plane. No marketing or pressure for you to but food or stuff like on Ryanair. You want priority boarding $10 and its yours.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Jim Lohbeck,28th October 2014,Flight scheduled to leave CVG at 12:46 pm on 10/10/14. Flight bumped to 1:30pm then 4:30 pm and then 6:30 pm. Upon boarding there was an odour of fuel in the back of the cabin. We were all ordered to get off the plane. After a half hour we were told to go home and the flight would take off 2.45 pm the next day. We were told that we were going to get $150 vouchers for future flights. We were not thrilled with having to deal with this airline again but we had no alternative except to miss our vacation all together. The next day since we had no other alternative on flights we reluctantly came back. This flight went well although they still felt compelled to charge for a soda as if no one on the flight had spent 10 hours at the airport the day before. Keep in mind that we used Allegiant's site to rent a car for 8 days - now we were down to 7 days. When we arrived at our destination the Alamo car rental rep told us that we would have to go through Allegiant to get reimbursed for the day we missed.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,Kelvyn Billings,28th October 2014,Provo UT to LAX on Oct 16 2014 flight 130 and 131. After I booked my flight I started to have second thoughts. Many people complained that the seats do not recline they sit back better than some of the popular airlines and do not need to recline. I think all airlines should have seats like this. Why should passengers in front of you be allowed to stick their seat in your space! The leg room was far better than most other airlines. Both my wife and all those that came with us were very happy with the seats. Could they have done a better job putting us all together - yes. If you have a lot of luggage you might be better off with a different airline. For the price I was very happy.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,9,T Walter,22nd October 2014,"Allegiant lured my friends and I in with very affordable fares from Lansing MI to Sanford FL (there and back again) for a mini-holiday in mid-October 2014. Our flight from Lansing was on time and the gate staff were efficient and pleasant. We boarded on time made it out to the tarmac and the captain announced that they had an open flap sensor warning and couldn't take off. We were back at the gate for about 10 minutes to check out the issue and then FL bound. The flight lasted approx. 2.5 hours and we arrived on time even with the small delay. The McDonnell Douglas MD80 was clean and as comfortable as is to be expected with single aisle 3-2 seating. The flight back was on time and we arrived in Michigan earlier than expected. The flight attendants were pleasant on both flights (not overly attentive but did their job). Our flight back to MI was smooth. Keep in mind Allegiant is a budget airline. If you don't want to pay the $5 fee to print your boarding pass at the airport do it at home. Bring snacks if you don't want to pay for snacks on board. There are no free food or drinks. Allegiant makes their money by charging for extras. I am 5'3"" and found the legroom to be sufficient. However if you are taller you may want to consider a row marked with extra legroom. I will say that we did pay extra when we booked our tickets to choose our seats (row 15 for minimal noise) and sit together. I recommend this if you are traveling with others and want to sit together. Allegiant got me to my destination safely efficiently and at a cost significantly less than other airlines. The added bonus of flying to/from smaller easier access airports not served by other airlines is a nice touch. I definitely would fly Allegiant again.",,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,5,S Beckman,22nd October 2014,Flight was cheap. Flew from Duluth MN to Las Vegas. The flight out was freezing and the flight back was hot. They save money by not turning anything on until you're in the air. No assistance from staff and the pilot remarked more than once that they are only on the plane for our safety. They just talked to each other the whole flight each way. Did load the App on my phone and scanned ticket so we saved money. You get what you pay for. Just be ready for it and read the fine print.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,9,L Arcarese,12th October 2014,Flew from Plattsburg NY to Sanford (Orlando) FL. The ride to and from was pleasant without any issues. I used their convenient iPhone app for boarding pass. Rode on an Airbus 320. It was a relatively short ride approx. 2hrs 20mins so you can't expect much. The airline caters to budget travellers with no frills. If you are looking for all the fancy stuff (reclining seats in-flight entertainment better food choices etc.) go elsewhere and pay more. As far as I'm concerned you get what you pay for and Allegiant fit my budget.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,L Beeman,5th October 2014,If you're flying out of Phoenix AZ area in the middle of the summer you may want to rethink this budget friendly airline! We arrived at the airport 2.5 Hrs prior to our flight leaving. Got through the baggage check security etc and arrived at our gate with about 1.5 hrs to spare. The temperature outside is well over 100 degrees so onboard the interior of the plane is very hot. Everyone is seated the plane is full and the flight attendants proceed to give the safety features etc meanwhile there is absolutely no air moving on that plane. I had no idea that Allegiant will not turn the air on until you've taken off! Meanwhile it is absolutely miserable! It would have been nice if the flight attendants would have at least made an announcement saying that they don't turn the a/c on until takeoff. The seats do not recline and there's very little leg room. I realize this is a cheap airline but I would rather pay more money to have the little extras like air conditioning during the summer in the desert seats that recline and free soda & snacks! After reading about others' horror stories with delays etc I'm thankful that we did not experience any of that! Our flights were on time but will not fly Allegiant again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,1,,2,no
Allegiant Air,10,Michael Ison,1st October 2014,Flew from LEX KY to Punta Gorda Florida four times. The last time was April of this year. Arrived on time flight was great crew were nice and for the age of the plane wasn't bad for what I paid. I couldn't afford to go if Allegiant wasn't around. Could not find a better airline for the price anywhere.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,K Ashley,28th September 2014,When our daughter decided to get married in Las Vegas my husband and I were not able to find a return flight on the necessary day so we decided to split our flights and we took a competitor's airline going to Vegas and Allegiant coming home to Billings Montana. The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines. I can honestly say that I would rather pay a little more to be able to get a drink of water if I need one and to have someone friendly and happy to see me come on board.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,8,Beard Lisa,28th September 2014,I enjoyed Allegiant as a whole. I flew to Las Vegas with my two children aged 10 years and 3 years of age. Staff was polite and friendly in answering any questions since it was our first time flying this airline. My itinerary was done online so there wasn't any hidden charges to expect. On the way home from Las Vegas the plane was already there and waiting and we were an hour and half early. Allegiant will see me a lot more often.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,Reed Truman,22nd September 2014,Well as we all know you get what you pay for. And with Allegient airlines that isn't much. The flights are cancelled delayed etc you are left to fend for yourself. It's questionable if any other airline would honor their tickets. The airline seems to be run with contract employees that have no vested interest in doing a good job. Customer service is rock bottom and some of the language they use on customers would make a sailor blush. The flight attendants really have nothing to do so on the flights I was on they pulled out the food carts in the galley sat on them and had a party. The amount I saved booking with them was more than consumed by expenses I paid for the delays and the mental aggravation of dealing with this airline. Never again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,7,A Mark,18th September 2014,Bellingham to Las Vegas - The MD80 was quite old but the cabin was clean and fine for a short flight. We had an aborted take off at Bellingham due to a faulty toilet. We stayed on the aircraft for an hour whilst they cleaned up the mess and took the lavatory out of service - lovely. At least we didn't have to change aircraft or get off the plane. We were on our way after an hour with no further delays or issue. The cabin crew were friendly and the pilots were very good at keeping everyone up to date with the delay and progress during the flight. I'd fly with Allegiant again although clearly they have reliability issues with their older aircraft which can cause unexpected delays but for the price I can't complain too much.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,2,J Baker,17th September 2014,Allegiant Air was a bad experience for me and my 7 year old. Booked a trip from Punta Gorda to Knoxville I almost didn't make out of Punta Gorda. We got to the airport early and then the flight was delayed (all of the flights were continuously delayed). One ticketing agent said it was weather but the weather was clear where the flight was coming from so I asked another agent and she said they didn't have enough crew. We were packed in that small airport like sardines with kids screaming people yelling not enough seats for people to sit in. They cancelled some of the other flights but finally got another plane and crew that came from Fort Lauderdale for my flight. Six hours after arriving at the airport we finally left. After this experience I will pay the extra money for another airline. My chances of getting out of an airport on time are better and at least I will have the option of being rebooked on another flight or getting compensated. Budget airline = budget experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,5,C Norton,17th September 2014,"Yes the price is certainly right and a direct flight is a definite plus especially for my husband who is handicapped. However in that vein this airline is certainly not handicap friendly. Ask for a wheelchair and they will sling one at you at the Check In (wherever that is in the airport). Upon disembarking the flight attendant announced that wheelchair persons would have to wait until all (159) passengers had left the plane. When my husband and I moved up to the front seats to wait at a break in the line the flight attendant said ""I told you to stay seated until all passengers had left the plane"". When a person finally arrived with a wheelchair and helped my husband up to the gate that's as far as they go. Carrying two bags of medical supplies and pushing the wheelchair we trudged off to baggage claim and then lugged everything out to the curb around the corner to a taxi. Had the same treatment on the flight home. But as I said the price is certainly right and you get what you pay for!",,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,9,Angie Chisholm,17th September 2014,Flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas on September 8th. We were very weary after reading negative reviews but we were 100% satisfied. Flight was on time for take off but delayed for landing due to weather in Las Vegas. Great employees friendly service. Very impressed overall. Would definitely fly Allegiant again. Great value. No free food or entertainment but we knew this when we booked.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,10,Daniel Talmadge,14th September 2014,"My parents have retired and moved to North Port Florida. Since March of 2013 I have flown on Allegiant Air 5 times. Besides one delay of about an hour we have always flown on time both ways. Oh by the way I fly out of Allentown Pa. Actually most of the returning flights have been early. I didn't mind the one delay it gave me an extra hour to enjoy a couple more cocktails. I do agree however the flight attendants are a tad bit rude. Maybe ""short"" is the correct word. But then again all they do is listen to a bunch of whimpering cry babies about a stupid delay. If you want first class go fly another airline and pay double the amount for a ticket. I also fly my 2 boys with me so I really can't complain about paying $500 to $650 for 3 round trip non stop tickets to see the parents for a week. Not to mention Allentown pa is 20 minutes from my home and Punta Gorda is 25 minutes from my parents. I will always fly Allegiant.",,,Economy Class,,,5,4,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,M Mollenhour,9th September 2014,"Do not be tempted by the cheap prices. You are assuming incorrectly that Allegiant will actually get you there and back. Wrong. July 2014: Return flight home from SFB (Sanford Florida) cancelled at the gate at boarding time on a Friday afternoon. This effectively left passengers stranded at an airport with no other flights out to the destination because flights out of SFB are very limited. MCO (Orlando International) is 30 miles south with ample alternative flights. However the Allegiant gate agent offered no group ground transportation to MCO offered no lodging and offered no thoughts on other flights out. Essentially: ""You are stranded here and on your own for getting out."" Because I travel with an Internet connected device I was able to buy a last-minute ticket on Delta (at last-minute prices) from MCO. I was able finally to find a rental car one way (cab fare was $135). My ""cheap"" Allegiant ticket cost me about $1000. I could have spent the entire weekend at the airport or at a nearby motel hoping to catch a flight out on Monday. When you buy an Allegiant ticket you are buying a chance - a hope - and gambling.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,S Paul,9th September 2014,Outbound flight Las Vegas to Grand Rapids (MI) was fine but on the return Allegiant had some staffing problems which led to delays and more delays and the flight eventually took off a full day late. It would not have been so bad if they had just been honest up front but they piecemeal the delays provided little information - and sometimes misinformation - and at times they were downright rude particularly on the phone where it was very challenging to get through in the first place. For the trouble they offered up a $100 voucher good only on the same route. The lost time and aggravation cost in many ways much more than anything I saved on a discount fare. Never again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,5,J Mack,6th September 2014,Flew from Orlando (Sanford) to Grand Rapids MI. Just a few things to be aware of - the weight limit on checked bags is 40 pounds. You are allowed one free carry-on bag provided it will fit under your seat. You have to pay to use the overhead compartment (the overhead compartments were bare on my flight). The seats are tight and do not recline. While boarding and sitting on the runway - Allegiant turns the cabin air conditioning down to save fuel so depending on the outside temperature it can get pretty hot. Their airplane fleet is made up primarily of older McDonnell-Douglas MD-80's - cabins show their age - noises and creaks aplenty. The flight crew aren't particularly helpful or pleasant but suffice. Now the positive - my ticket was 139 dollars. There you go.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,MJ Pono,6th September 2014,My Honolulu to LAX and LAX to HNL flights were a disaster. Reading the reviews this particular Allegiant route seems to be a problem route for Allegiant. HNL to LAX flight was delayed continuously for 5 hours. A 7.55 am flight turned into 1.00 pm flight. The return flight was continuously delayed until finally the flight was canceled until the following day. A 15 hour delay. Rather than return to the city and rent a hotel room I was fortunate to book a flight on Hawaiian Airlines and make it back home. Customer service staff was openly hostile to enraged customers. I have never in all of my travels seen such a large group of travelers so upset. I was offered a $200 Allegiant voucher for the delay but I cannot ever see myself using this airline again. The risk stress and wasted days are just not worth the $100 you save.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Linda Martin,6th September 2014,My return trip from Ft. Wayne In. was delayed for 1.5 hrs while waiting on the plane. We were told after boarding that they were waiting for maintenance to arrive in order to replenish plane with oxygen. This was during dinner time so everyone was hungry. When we finally took off we were told we would get a complementary non- alcoholic drink. It consisted of a tiny plastic cup filled mostly with ice. We should have at least have got a full can plus a snack. Really cheap airline. This was at least the 5th time I have experienced delays due to mechanical problems.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Taraneh Rasta,1st September 2014,Horrible experience going from LA to Hawaii and from Hawaii to LA. Our flight was canceled twice the second time the plane took off but the generator was not working so we had to return to the island. The ticket may look cheap but they will charge you for every thing! Your bags change in seats and so forth. They don't even provide you with a glass of water unless you purchase it.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Marty Coulson,1st September 2014,We know what to expect from a budget airline. But Allegiant has in my opinion has got worse instead of better. On our most recent trip Bellingham WA to Oakland CA we experienced lengthy delays on both outbound and return flights. A 2 hour delay leaving Bellingham and a 2+ hour delay on the return flight. Allegiant provided free beverages at both airports. Sodas and water in Bellingham and a half glass of water in Oakland. I think it's time for this airline to have a look at the business model. You don't save enough money flying Allegiant to make up for the almost guaranteed inconvenience of flying with them. We will think long and hard before purchasing another ticket on Allegiant. I must say that this is not my first bad experience with Allegiant but it will be my last.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,A Biedel,1st September 2014,We arrived at LAX for at 9am for a 10.55am flight to Provo UT (80 minute flight). We have now been informed that the flight is not scheduled to leave until 6.25pm. I am a 40 year old woman and have flown all my life and I have never experienced this type of a delay especially for this short of a flight. Allegiant is cheap but this is inexcusable. I am traveling with a toddler and as it stands right now we have spent over 7 hours at the airport and will probably be here at least 2 more hours if not more. No one will let us know what is going on.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Adam Wettach,1st September 2014,I show up 2.5 hrs early only to find out there is nearly an hour delay. The airport in Provo has zero accommodation so had to drive 15 minutes away to get any food. Come back approx an hour before flight is to leave only to be told it's been delayed another 4hrs. Called in to complain to receive an extremely rude woman on the phone. Sitting outside waiting still and just found out flight has been delayed yet another 1.5 hrs. The couple of bucks saved flying this unprofessional airline just isn't worth the stress.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,,,,no
Allegiant Air,10,M Meyer,26th August 2014,My first Allegiant Air experience. I booked two weeks in advance. Traveled from LAX to Idaho Falls. I go to Jackson Hole WY every summer and I always have to get creative about getting there as there are always high ticket prices. I decided to give this airline a go. Both flights were on time - every aspect was fine. Yes it is no-frills and you pay for everything but if you know that going in you can adapt. We became better packers and brought our own food onboard.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,J Ranson,26th August 2014,We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to the flight. We encountered an enormous line with not enough attendants to get everyone through. We waited for an hour+ in the line and then approached the counter to express our concern. We waited behind others who were complaining for another 20 minutes or so. We were then told that we had missed our flight and for $75 we could catch their next flight 3 days later. We persisted but in a very respectful manner. Other families in the same situation were also at the counter and were very angry. I saw this was not working so I took a different approach. I was accused of lying about the time I spent in line. I was told I had no other recourse. There was nobody I could complain to other than another rude lady on the phone. After exhausting all other avenues I went to Delta Airways who were able to book me on a flight. for $1200 for 2 people. They said they were willing to transfer the flight if Allegiant was willing to do that given it was their lineups that caused the delay. Allegiant refused this and again accused me of lying and then said I should have been there 2.5 hours before the flight so it was my fault. Service at the counter was excellent. Service on the flight was professional and friendly. Everything I had experienced with Allegiant on the trip to Vegas and the frustrating airport experience on the way back was the opposite of what I experienced with Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,A Hardy,26th August 2014,"You should not use Allegiant if you have any time constraints. When they're good they're pretty good but when they're bad they're horrible! We have flown Allegiant Air at least 5 times and ignored a problem or two because it was cheap. Usually there was an hour or two delay. One time there were no attendants at the counter and when it was time to board all passengers boarded. An Allegiant employee came aboard and in a very nasty tone threatened to have us all arrested. Our last flight had a ""delay"" of over 10 hours and that's just not acceptable. We were given a $50 Allegiant voucher. No thank you.",,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,M Jourdain,26th August 2014,Have used this airline 2 times out of Plattsburgh NY via For Lauderdale FL. We experienced issues on both occasions departing Fort Lauderdale. The first incident was back in December 2012 - flight was delayed for 8 hours and then in December 2013 flight was cancelled until the next day. I will not fly this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,2,,4,no
Allegiant Air,10,M Brim,18th August 2014,I flew Allegiant for the first time from Las Vegas to Moline Illinois 8/8/14 and returned on 8/15/14. Both flights were on time and very convenient as they were non stop. Prior to these flights all my trips were on other airlines where I had layovers and plane changes which added lots of extra travel time. I was very pleased with the check in service I received. The seats were comfortable for a three hour flight. I did not need a food or beverage service during the short flights. The charges for luggage still did not make the total cost more than for the flights of the other non direct carriers. I would fly Allegiant again and I wanted to make my good experiences known because I read many of the comments before my flight and some were quite negative.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,8,J Mccullough,13th August 2014,Columbus to Myrtle Beach. Flying out of Rickenbacker was great-parking at $5 per day. No delay and nice employees to deal with. Paid $5 for a snack package on the plane. Good enough for 3 kids. Myrtle Beach to Columbus. Nice airport and easy car rental. Employee at the gate check in and boarding had a poor attitude. Changed seats on us at the last minute. They board you in zones 2-4. In that order. We sat in the last row of the plane but they wanted us to board in zone 4? Made no sense-I've always seen the back of the plane board first but maybe that makes to much sense to me. Anyway I would recommend this MD-80 plane and Allegiant even though seats don't recline.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Latonya Sopshire,13th August 2014,This was my worst flying experience. Every other time I've flown with no problems. My Son was able to fly from Bentonville to Orlando with his personal bag with no problems. On the way back we are forcedbto pay a $50 baggage fee to get the bag on the flight only to get back to Bentonville Ar. to find out the bag was left but the fees where still charged and then reversed and charged again! I think the ticket agents that worked the 12.56pm flight leaving Sanford Airport on Aug 8 2014 need to take a few classes.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,2,,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,E Morgan,11th August 2014,I was initially worried about flying with Allegiant when I read all of the terrible reviews. Shockingly neither of my flights were delayed from LAX to Honolulu. If you're a low maintenance person then this airline is for you. You get what you pay for no reclining seats no complimentary beverages ($2 for a can of ginger ale not bad in my opinion) no inflight entertainment you have to pay for any extra features and to check in your bags. The staff was very friendly. We even landed 20 minutes early coming back to LAX since everyone on the flight checked in early. The only reason why I took this flight was because it was $400 cheaper than the next flight. I would have no problem flying with Allegiant again to save a few dollars!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,3,D Bardsley,11th August 2014,After some apparent misrepresentations about our 1st plane we left Sanford at about the same time that we should have arrived in Allentown. Of course we boarded a 2nd plane only about 1.5 hours late but could not depart because it had an A/C problem which was corrected in a mere hour as we sat entombed under the FL sun! No flight attendants displayed name badges. Does that tell you anything?,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,2,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,10,Jack Bigelow,11th August 2014,Flew Allegiant June 30th to Vegas and back on July 4th Trip was great. Left ATW on time and arrived in Vegas on the.time The ticket counter were great no problems Flight crew were just fine. Ok the seats don't recline no big deal only 3 1/2 hour flight. We brought our own snacks and bought soda at the airport. Return trip also left on time and arrived on times. ALL in all Love flying Allegiant we have never problems never once a delayed flight going to keep flying with them.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,2,Erika Holden,6th August 2014,July 31st stuck at airport. Flight has been delayed. From all the reviews I have read this is apparently a reoccurring issue with this airline. Allegiant need to get their act together. They charge for everything so don't think you are saving money because you are not. You can fly better airlines and save yourself the stress.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,J Schaller,5th August 2014,Outbound flight was 4 hours delayed. We were locked in gate area with no food or beverage service. Prior to delay flight attendants acted immature and more concerned about showing kids the cockpit than getting passengers settled and allowing captain to do his job. After we finally had another plane show up the flight attendant had the gall to refuse me a glass of water I was told water 8s $2 per bottle. Now on the return it is delayed and there is no one at gate to tell us when it will be here. Totally deserted. The most inept service ever. I will never fly them again. Do not fly Allegiant they do not care if or when you get to your destination.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,10,S Arctic,5th August 2014,We just came back from our vacation to Florida flying round trip from NIA to PIE with 11 people including 3 seniors 3 young adults 4 kids (ranging from 3 to 11 in age) and a 2 month old infant. After reading the reviews here we were very concerned especially about the delays but were pleasantly surprised. Both flights exactly on time and arrived a little earlier than scheduled. The staff both in the airline as well as at the airport were extremely helpful and extra friendly. The airplane on the way there was a little older but on the way back the plane seemed new. This is a budget airline with the lowest rates around so that needs to be kept in mind. There are no frills luggage is charged a premium and there are no free refreshments. IMO the flight is just to get me to my destination quickly safely and at a reasonable rate so I will definitely be traveling with Allegiant again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,5,2,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,D Hull,5th August 2014,Allentown to Orlando Sanford on 28th July 2014 and return flight from Orlando Sanford to Allentown on 1st August 2014. Very poor quality airline used them from PA to Florida and back and they were over 3 hrs late going and 2 hrs late returning the staff attitude ranged from poor to average and if I had a choice I would not fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,L Tyler,5th August 2014,Supposed to fly from Peoria IL to Vegas on July 24 at 8pm. Flight was canceled due to an engine issue. We were rescheduled to the following day July 25 at 5pm. Unfortunately there was a three hour delay. We lost 24 hours of our trip. While Peoria is a pleasant little town can you really equate 24 hours there to be the same as 24 hours in Vegas? On the return flight July 27 we boarded without issue at 2.20pm. We were on the plane for 3 hours before we even took flight - we were 44th in line for take off and then ran low on fuel. Pilot took us back to terminal to gas up. For our inconvenience Allegiant Air offered us vouchers totalling $150 for our next flight. Problem is we are never flying with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,9,TJ Morales,5th August 2014,I knew what we were getting into with this airline. We were prepared for the worst. With that said we followed every little thing they asked on their website from online check in to weighing each check in luggage and their app to check for delays. Our party consisted of 5 Adults 3 children and 2 infants. Maybe its sheer luck that we escaped going to our vacation in Oahu and coming back to LAX. The flight going to Oahu was on time they did not give anything complimentary but that's expected. Yes the seats did not recline. We brought food and drinks from the LAX. Flight left approximately 2pm. The delay came from LAX only having one runway available. Our entire party came in 2 hours early just in case. At the check-in line everything went through without a hitch no additional fees added. 8 days later we had an early flight 9.30 am going back to LAX. Again we knew what to expect We did the online check in and printed the boarding passes constantly checking alerts for delays through the app/text alert. They had 2 lines at Lobby 6 one for online check in the other is a more general line. I'm glad we did the online check in the general line was a bit too long. Got through ticket counter no hitches. After the TSA check point we were in gate 22 along with other passengers with 45 minutes to spare. Bought food and drinks at the airport. After boarding I noticed the plane had some condensation dripping from the ceiling. The window by my seat was broken had a tough time trying to close it so light couldn't get in. Flight left on time arrived in LAX on time. When we arrived there was a shuttle to take us to the gate I don't know if that's normal but everything else came through okay. They even gave us free drinks since my sister's twin infants were pretty quiet for the duration of the flight. The crew were nice gave the kids badges. With that said I would fly with them again. With knowing what to expect. A couple of things check in online and sign for text alerts if you can don't check in luggage if you can get away with a carryon. Be prepared just in case of delays.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,2,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Y Bar,5th August 2014,Do not recommend! Flight from Stockton CA was great but there was a 3 hour delay from LV to Stockton. For a 1 hour flight - a 3 hour wait? There is not even bad weather. They only offered complementary drinks. Not worth it.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,1,,1,no

Allegiant Air,10,Fleischer Michael,2nd August 2014,Stockton to Las Vegas. Hear all these complaints so I was a little worried when I booked. The flight left on time pilots and crew very friendly landed in Vegas - ready to go and on time. Also these super 80's they fly might be old but they deliver a smooth ride. I'll definitely fly this outfit again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,D Winter,31st July 2014,We have recently travelled with Allegiant on flights to and from Vegas/Hawaii. Never again! The flight was 6 hours only snacks could be purchased inflight and only by credit card (being from the UK this would incur all kinds of extra charges) and could not be purchased with cash. Allegiant also purposely sat myself and my partner at opposite ends of the plane so we were forced to pay the extra charge to sit next to each other even though there were plenty of spare seats next to each other on the plane. This happened both ways. Seats do not recline at all not even a tiny bit and were uncomfortable. Will not fly with this company again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,R Bodley,29th July 2014,July 18th from CVG to Sanford was a 4 hour delay no explanation except computers went down/very costly after you pay for seat choice/carry on/luggage/and no customer service whatsoever. Coming back to CVG left on time and arrived on time but it took luggage an hour to come out after landed again no care or explanation.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,Iris Rivas,29th July 2014,I thought this was one of the worst travel experiences I've ever had. It was the first time I flew with my 5 month old daughter we were the last to board my husband and son boarded first they had no priority boarding for people with small children the aircraft was old and dirty. There was a charge for everything including carry ons which I paid but refused to pay the fee to sit together. I thought the airline was tacky and cheap. I can understand paying for something that's new or worth it but this airline was old and sub standard. Luckily it was a short flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,2,Roy Stanforth,29th July 2014,Flew from CVG to Myrtle Beach on July 18th (flight 1113) and returned to CVG on July 25th (6pm gate B2). Both flights were delayed for over 2 hrs. The return flight was loaded and taxied with a 30 minute delay the final 1.5 hours was sitting on a plane with no air in the Myrtle Beach sun. Staff was nice and did their best older flight attendant (woman) was spectacular. Sorry doubt if we will use this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,Franklin Tower,27th July 2014,Sanford to Rickenbacker flight 614 on 7/10/14 and the return trip from Rickenbacker to Sanford flight 615 on 7/17/14. Horrible experience. Twice to the flight line and twice unable to takeoff due to equipment problems. Finally they subbed another plane. Our flight was over 6 hours late. Dirty plane diaper contents under seat in front of us. Old noted silicone caulk around and on emergency hatches. I have to add mouthy rude sarcastic staff.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,D Scott,27th July 2014,If Allegiant could do what they promise it could be a great but they can't seem to do that. Not enough pilots or planes no back up planes. My May 26th flight from Peoria to Vegas was cancelled after several delays. At 1am the desk girl gleefully announced the plane had arrived everybody cheered. Then after everybody got off the plane she announced with great surprise that the crew had timed out and couldn't fly. Something passengers had already figured would probably happen. Allegiant should have told us earlier so we didn't have to sit around the airport for 3 hours waiting. They knew but didn't tell the passengers. They also add on extra fees to make you think the flight is going to be cheaper. I want to like and fly this airline it could be great. This is just one incident of many messed up trips.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,2,,4,no
Allegiant Air,9,L Connors,27th July 2014,Recently flew from Bangor Maine to Orlando Florida. Excellent service friendly flight attendants. Departed and arrived on time both leaving and returning. The ticket agent however in Bangor was not very helpful. My daughter and husband were travelling with two children and required a baby seat. They had checked and were told the baby seat was allowed with no charge. The agent didn't think the car seat qualified. After bringing in another to consult she finally allowed it but was not very nice about it. A little customer service goes a long way. A great experience and I would take this flight to Orlando again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,7,L Peters,25th July 2014,My daughter and I flew from Avoca Pa to Sanford Orlando from July 3-10. We greatly enjoyed our smooth flights and onboard service. However there were delays going down and coming back of about an hour. I know Allegiant has great deals but need to improve on these delays for better traveling. Even though there were delays I will still chose Allegiant for future travels due to the value and convenience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,E Leet,22nd July 2014,We took a flight from Phoenix-Gateway to Hawaii in July 2014 and I was not impressed. The aircraft was okay but once airborne they announced there was no food available for sale other than chips and drinks. A 6 hour flight and no food? Our return was delayed 5 hours. No reason given. The flight originated in Hawaii so it had to be a maintenance issue. During our 5 hour wait we were forced to move so another airline could use our area to feed their customers. The ticket prices and their charging practices would be considered deceptive anywhere else. I've been traveling for nearly 40 years in the US and abroad and I have to say worst airlines ever. Don't do it. In the end the price is the same (or cheaper) going with a real customer oriented company.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,L Kapcala,22nd July 2014,We recently flew to Los Angeles with Allegiant Air and are thrilled that we have discovered this affordable airline option. We read all of their information so knew to weigh our luggage before leaving home as well as to bring our own snacks. We had a 50 minute flight delay which we were informed about via text. We downloaded their app which also enabled us to check in 24 hrs before and avoid the need for printing boarding passes. We had a gate change again no big deal. All the gates are in the same large room at LAX. The staff were helpful and informative - one suitcase was slightly overweight. They gave us time to transfer some items to another suitcase to avoid paying overage charges. We had a suitcase go missing - it was fed exed to our hotel after being located with Customer Service being very helpful with this issue. I would much rather pay these kinds of prices (our savings approx $1000 for 2 people) then pay to have an airline provide me an onboard coke and movie. I have dealt with flight delays lost luggage and gate changes with other airlines as well so feel these issues are not unique to Allegiant Air.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,K Limko,20th July 2014,Bellingham to Vegas. Flight was to depart 11.05 am. At 8 am we received notice flight would be delayed 30 minutes. About 1 hour later while heading to the airport to be 2 hours early we received a second text saying flight delayed again until 1.30. Stop for breakfast and get to the airport 2 hours early as requested. Get a 3rd text explaining flight is delayed until 3.30. How did it take 3 cracks to figure out when we were leaving? Seat assignments caused another 30 minute delay as passengers boarded. Allegiant flies about 8 trips a day to Vegas and it is certainly not uncommon to expect delays. Luckily we only sat in the plane in Vegas in 110 degree temperatures for an extra hour delay on the return trip. Sounds bad but certainly an improvement. So if you plan on taking advantage of the cheap flight remember you get what you pay for and don't expect any professionalism or comfort along the way.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,3,M Posada,20th July 2014,Flew from Ashville to Punta Gorda. When I got to the airport I was told that the flight was delayed due to a mechanical we were expected to be late about 3 hours no offer of a voucher for a meal nor did they apologize it was very matter of fact. When we boarded the plane the first thing I noticed was how dirty and tattered the plane was it was an older MD-80. My seat was clean didn't recline I was more annoyed with the garbage that was surrounding my seat and in my seat back pocket and when I rang my Flight Attendant call light I was approached by a rude older male flight attendant who refused to take the garbage until after we took off. Once we were at cruising altitude the crew came out and sold all sorts of snacks and beverages not bad. Had an issue with my hand baggage being in the aisle. Allegiant as a whole was not a bad experience the ticket was inexpensive I would like if Allegiant perhaps gave their Flight Attendants especially those lovely seniors a class in etiquette and professionalism.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,J Udall,20th July 2014,My flight was delayed a total of 7 hours because the Allegiant crew failed to make proper mechanical checks before departure. I arrived a full 2 hours before the flight was scheduled to leave. We boarded on schedule then sat in our cramped hot seats for 90 minutes. Then we were asked to deplane so the crew could fix something. We then sat in the terminal for 2.5 hours. We boarded again. We deplaned again. We boarded a final time and were actually able to take off from LAX. I arrived home 10 hours past my original arrival time. Obviously I will never be flying with Allegiant again!,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,5,James Walcott,15th July 2014,"TOL (Toledo) Ohio to PGD (Punta Gorda) Florida. Check In: Went smooth no issues with checking in and sent on my way. Security: Efficient and quick. Boarding: Very unorganized the gate agents didn't seem to have a grasp on customer service either. Boarding announced by someone who couldn't speak properly into the phone and 90% of her message never came through we all just sort of looked perplexed and formed a queue only to be snapped at for not boarding in the correct manner of which we never really heard. Upon entry into the old and tattered MD-80 we were greeted by a very sweet young lady and an older middle aged asian man who never smiled and he swiftly snapped at me ""Seat Sir"" he was the lead flight attendant and we all would endure his wrath later. Flight: Take off was quick the crew were up and out in the aisle within an hour after take off that probably had something to do with the argument the flight attendants were having in the rear. Once in the aisle the crew were pleasant and were very happy to be doing their jobs or at least they appeared so. Overall: You get for what you pay for apart from that not too bad.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,1,,5,no
Allegiant Air,7,C Lee,15th July 2014,"Oakland CA to Provo Utah. Initially I was very excited to use this airline as I saw that the price for the trip was much less expensive than the usual commercial airlines flying into SLC. However I was disappointed as I continued the checking process and realized that I had to pay additional money for seats and for carry-on luggage. I then realized the total cost is not that significantly cheaper than Delta or another big airline. However I bought my tickets only 3 weeks in advance and may have saved significant money if I had purchased the tickets much earlier. I arrived to OAK 2.5 hours early in case there were any problems. Security clearance was a breeze. I am happy to say that there were no issues with delays or cancellations on this leg of the trip. The service was very good. Yes all beverages/snacks must be purchased but it is only a 1.5 hr flight and really who needs to drink/eat in that time. I can see why customers complained about the comfort of the seats as the backs are very thin and do not give a lot of cushion support. Anyway I had paid for a first row seat and I'm glad I did as I could easily get off the plane without waiting. I'm happy to say that I had no problems with my flight but I do wish the total price of the trip was much more of a ""deal"" than what I got in reality.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,1,J Coleman,15th July 2014,Flew July 11 2014 from Las Vegas to Casper WY - flight attendants were either inattentive or rude. Thought it was just a one time occurrence but we flew back from Casper WY to Las Vegas on Monday July 14th and the crew was worse. Plane was filthy front lavatory was inoperable. Spend the extra money and fly on an airline that at least acknowledges that are a person first and a customer second!,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Suzette Green,15th July 2014,Never ever again. The planes are not clean the staff are not friendly and the fees are unbelievable. The maximum luggage weight is 40 lbs which will render a full size suitcase overweight almost 100% of the time. Starting September 2014 they are going to start charging to print boarding passes at the airport. Relentless!,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,V Kipling,13th July 2014,July 9/14 checked in at 4.30am for a 6.30 flight to Fargo ND. Our tickets were for gate 31 but verbally told to go to gate 39. It was approaching 6.30 and my daughter asked the 2 staff there why we were not boarding yet and she told us our plane was at gate 31! Got to the gate at 6.25ish and there were 3 other people there as well we had missed our flight. We could see the plane still there but the door was locked. There were no staff to assist. The plane remained at the runway terminal for about 15 min. The next flight out of L.A. airport to Fargo was 3 days away! Our only option to get back home was to take a flight to Sioux Falls South Dakota rent a car and drive to Fargo. The flight to Sioux was delayed 1.5 hrs but miraculously it was ready in about 20min. So were were led out of the airport onto the tarmac and loaded from the rear of the plane! Allegiant Air does not have a PA system so they solely rely on yelling loud enough for their passengers to hear of any changes or to advise of boarding! I will say that they decided to waive the 75.00 fee for switching to fly to Sioux or at least for 4 of us that I know of. We paid for preferred seating yet out of Fargo 2 of us had what we paid for and one ticket had been changed for seating 4 rows back. Luckily one seat was empty and we were able to sit in preferred.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,1,,1,no

Allegiant Air,7,M Jenkins,10th July 2014,I recently used this airline to travel round trio from Belleville IL to Orlando FL. I suppose to summarize I would categorize this as a fair airline. If you are planning travel with them make sure you take note of all the charges as basically everything (including advance seat selection etc) has an a la carte separate charge. Also the departing flight was two hours late and there was no explanation given by Allegiant staff as to why. The advantage of this airline is it flew out of a small general aviation airport that obviated the need for me to travel to St Louis. Recommended but be aware of all charges and propensity to lateness.,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,2,2,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,Carol Carter,8th July 2014,I was a loyal Allegiant customer from their inception flying with them dozens of times. My last 3 flights via Allegiant have been cancelled/rescheduled - all for supposed mechanical issues for the following day - often after our having already been en route to the airport. That's 3 flights within 30 days! Customer service is non- existent. Communications about status are lagging even with signing up for text alerts. Yesterday's flight was rescheduled 4 times in 8 hours only to finally be cancelled after passengers had been held all day on standby/stand down. The only compensation offered is a $100 travel voucher for future travel.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,John Ballenger,8th July 2014,Fly from GSP to SFB frequently. If you like riding a bus this is the airline for you. Cheap yes. In every way. Their fares look great until you start adding up all the extra charges. Never on time and if you have baggage pack a meal while you wait for it! Most uncomfortable seating ever. I guess if you only fly once a year it's OK to be inconvenienced but if you need to be somewhere on time look elsewhere!,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,2,C Williams,8th July 2014,On July 3 I lflew out of Asheville NC for Sanford/Orlando as this was my first time flying with Allegiant. I printed out my online boarding pass arrived before the time indicated and received an official boarding pass which indicated which gate I was to go to board the plane. The flight was on time and the pilot and crew were very courteous. Was a great flight! However the return was a disaster! On July 6 I was to fly out of Palm Beach Intentional. As before I printed my online boarding pass and arrived before the time indicated. This time I did not receive an official boarding pass indicating what time I was to go to board the plane. Instead I received the printed boarding pass that I proved which was torn in half and the gate number written on it. She instructed me to go to the left towards security and afterwards I would see the areas that indicated which gates. I went through security as usual and then proceeded to the gate written on the boarding pass. At the gate there were very few people there and I saw no Allegiant advertising. I asked someone who worked at the airport and she said yes you have the right gate. Since ever all flights were being delayed due to bad weather in the area I thought mine had been as well. About 10 minutes after the flight was to take off I saw one of the Allegiant employees who had been checking people in when I arrived. I asked if the flight had been delayed. She told me no I had missed my flight. I showed her my boarding pass with the hand written gate number on it. She informed me that that was the wrong gate and that she didn't recognize the hand writing. I feel that if I had been given an official boarding pass that indicated the gate number I would not have missed my flight.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,R Roth,8th July 2014,Rockford to Orlando round trip. Long delays both legs. The rudest flight attendants would rather sit in back and Delayed by 6 hours on 6/23 from Rockford to Tampa. Delayed by over 3 hours on 7/4 from Tampa to Rockford with no information about why there was a delay. Last month I had a similar delay from Rockford to Tampa and a flight cancelled from Tampa to Rockford. (On that flight they gave us a 100 credit but it cost me $50 in airport cab fare.) Always seems to be a delay with this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,3,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Kim Friend,6th July 2014,Rockford to Orlando round trip. Long delays both legs. The rudest flight attendants would rather sit in back and play with their phones. When they have delays or cancellations you are in trouble since only one flight to destinations every few days. First and last time using them. I will stick with major airlines. Not a convenience of small airport or saving if not able to get to where you are going.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,A Wolf,6th July 2014,June 22/23 were 859 and 5859 from CVG to PIE. After experiencing 7 delays plus a total cancellation of our flight on June 22 this is the bottom line (according to me). Allegiant is simply unable to accommodate delays (weather/mechanical) flight crew timing out or what have you. The fleet is very small so they cannot put you on another flight like the other big carriers can nor do they have contracts with other airlines to re-book you and get you on your way. After the headaches disappointment worry and trouble I went through for my trip the savings was just not worth it. Its not to say that Delta does not experience issues they do they are just better able to accommodate and/or offer options.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Vera Freeze,6th July 2014,My family flew out of Knoxville Tennessee to Sanford Florida on Flight 697 Sunday June 29 2014. This was our first and last time flying with Allegiant. The overhead cool air did not work. Therefore the air in the plane was hot and stale. We had to fan ourselves with the Allegiant emergency instruction card. I am thankful the card was available as that is the only good comment I would have for Allegiant. Allegiant's staff were fully aware the air was not working during the previous flight as well. We were advised air was blown into the plane to cool it down inside as the inside temperature was over 85% from the previous flight and that the problem was repaired prior to our boarding. The repair statement was not true. Shame on Allegiant and the staff as well. Being truthful and apologizing for the problem would have made a difference. Instead their lack of concern and deceit has lost three customers.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,,2,no

Allegiant Air,8,Jim Pettinelli,1st July 2014,6/12 flight No. 2073 departing at 8.30 am. Allegiant has no secrets of who and what they are. My trip from LAX to Hawaii was on time. Check-in was quicker than others Allegiant does not have as many forms and paperwork. Flight crew was pleasant and offered good service. Yes $2 for water or coke-but only $5 for Vodka on the rocks. If you are over 6 feet your knees will be flush against the seat in front of you. We saved $140 each on our round trip to and from Hawaii. I will use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,2,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,10,B Gordon,1st July 2014,6/19 - 6/26. Flight 1115 and 1114. I recently flew from LEX to Myrtle Beach and back on this airline. I read all the directions and requirements showed up prepared and on time with the luggage I prepaid for. It was a wonderful experience and a great bargain. I hope they keep this flight because I plan to use it several times a year and with the friendly staff and price it has made my trips possible.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,10,Duston Bill,1st July 2014,I just returned from a round trip on Allegiant from Greensboro - St. Pete. I have absolutely no complaints about the airline. This is a super discount airline. If you keep that in mind when you book your reservation you should not be too surprised when the final price of your ticket is determined. I have no comment on delayed flights. On none of the ~10 round-trips that I have taken with Allegiant have we been delayed more than 1/2 hour. Cabin crew and ground crew on all flights have been courteous and professional. I will definitely be flying Allegiant again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Dean Brekke,25th June 2014,I was on two flights: from Phoenix to Sioux falls SD and back. My flight to Sioux Falls was delayed 3 hours because of an attendant who called in sick and no one was available. My return flight #123 was delayed when the plane would not start. It was delayed and delayed and delayed. Each for an hour or two. Finally at 9.35 pm my 1.34 flight was cancelled. Although I was housed overnight at a local hotel even that was a challenge. I had flown 2 times before with no trouble but that was a few years back. I cannot trust arrival or return any more. My co-workers wife had a similar experience just yesterday.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,L Marcum,25th June 2014,"I am waiting for my delayed flight out of Des Moines airport as I write this review. My husband and I have been here since 4.40 when check-in for the 6.51 flight opened. It is now almost 8pm. In the over 3 hours we have been here we have received two texts advising of delays. When we checked in we were advised of the first delay and later also heard over the airport PA that the flight had been delayed a second time. Our flight is now due to depart after 10pm for a 1.30 am arrival in Orlando. Around 7.00 we decided we should get some dinner since we were going to be up and in the air until the wee hours. So we visit every restaurant on the gate side of security to learn every single one closes their grill at 7pm. We go back to the gate and the only airport personnel we can find tells us they don't work for Allegiant and they cant help us. After talking to one of the cashiers we find out the restaurants on the other side of security are open until 8.30. So we get TSA's blessing and head out in search of food. After securing a meal my husband decides to visit the Allegiant ticket counter to complain. His point and mine is if you are going to delay flights until after the restaurants close you'd think they could let passengers know food wont be available. It's not like the passengers from out of state know anything about this small airport's business practices. Instead of nodding apologizing and offering some words of comfort the ticket agent asked for my husband's license. As my husband handed it over and told the agent he didn't want a free ticket or drink vouchers the agent said ""I'm not giving you anything free. I'm kicking you off the flight."" My husband had to basically beg to be let back on the flight and was told if they heard any more comments or complaints about or from him he would not get on the plane. I assure you we will never fly Allegiant again!",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,T Prince,25th June 2014,LAX-ICT. I've flown routes with them in the past. I'm a frequent traveler and pretty flexible but this trip took the cake and I will never fly with them again. Gate/ticket area agents lack either knowledge or skill or both and are not of any assistance. Flights are never on time. Text alerts are sketchy at best so no predictability in communication. You will pay whether it's in the very high baggage fees/change fees/seat fees/lost time.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,Jace Nava,18th June 2014,Flew from Provo Utah for my honeymoon. We got a good price but in all honesty we're more than willing now to travel the 60 minutes to Salt Lake to fly on any other airline for a little higher price. The comfort of the seats on the Allegiant flights was horrendous and the service staff was cold and ironically un-serviceable. Our flight back from LAX was also delayed for no apparent reason but I got a text when we finally boarded that informed me my flight was delayed. Communication was horrible. Luckily my wife and I are a little more aware in airport situations; a couple sitting next to us thought they'd missed their flight because the marquee above our gate had changed and no announcement had been made about the delay. Very poor customer service. The hour and a half I save in driving time to our local airport is not worth what I lose out on with more professional airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,4,no
Allegiant Air,10,B Driscoll,16th June 2014,Have flown out of Grand Island NE to Phoenix/Mesa twice in the past two years. All departures were on time as well as arrivals. Staff at both ends pleasant.

Allegiant Air,5,Judy Graham,13th June 2014,I flew from Portsmouth NH to Punta Gorda FL in May on vacation with a friend. Everything about the flight itself was mostly fine. Free parking walk right in and check your bags with hardly any waiting. Security was quick and the flight was on time. They did have some computer glitches and thought it would be delayed however it was not. I did have two issues one was resolved the other was not. My TV screen did not work. They reset it 3 times and finally it worked. My biggest issue however was the return flight. 40 minutes from landing they put the seatbelt sign on with no warning. Then they absolutely refused to allow anyone to use the restroom. Several people tried to use the restroom and they made them sit back down and wait until landing.I will use Allegiant again because it was cheap and very convenient.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,1,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,David Smyth,10th June 2014,Have flown several times with Allegiant without incident. Typically I've showed up about an hour before departure time with only carry on. The Plattsburg NY airport has one flight departing at that time and therefore with pre- check-in done and a boarding pass security is a 3-5 minute affair and I'd wait about 35-40 min to board. Pleasant professional on-board staff. Departs on time arrives on time. No complaints until I should up a bit late. Traveling with wife daughter and two young grand children to FL for a family vaca. Due to circumstances beyond our control the usual 2 hr drive took 2.5 hrs. 30 min before departure they refused to check our one pre- paid checked bag saying no room left but directed us to security and suggested we gate check it. This made no sense to me cause gate checked goes in regular baggage hold which is apparently full. The large bag with fluids clearly got the attention of TSA and stalled our progress for about 10 minute. Upon reaching the end of security row an Allegiant agent was waiting for us saying we can't board the door is closed and he can't open it. This was about 10 prior to departure. We walked out to our car and watched the plane parked at the jetway for 15 minutes more. Rebooked on next flight (3 days later). Arrived early. Everything went smoothly. Sat in plane till departure time. Door closed 1 minute before push back from jetway. Total cost for rebooking car rental rebooking baby gear rental rebooking $1250. Why did we re book with Allegiant? No competition at Plattsburg and our return flights already booked. Delta out of Montreal charges about $75 more return and free carry-on. Pretty much break-even and better schedule flexibility.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,J Nimtz,9th June 2014,I am waiting for my flight to depart Rockford for St Petersburg as I write this complaint. Today is June 9 2014 and my bad experience with Allegiant started last Monday. We left our home near Orlando and drove to St Petersburg for our flight. We arrived early checked in and waited in the gate area. 10 minutes before we were to board we were told that there was a delay of 1.5 hours. Again about 10 minutes before we were to board we were told that the flight was cancelled. At this point we were sent to ticketing to receive hotel vouchers. After being given a voucher we were instructed to get our luggage and wait outside the baggage area for a shuttle to the hotel. No information as to which hotel we were being taken to or any representative from Allegiant to organize or supervise the process. To make issues worse when we arrived at the airport the next morning we checked in and went to the assigned gate. Once through security we found that the restaurant and gift shop were closed and there were no options to purchase any food or drinks and Allegiant did not provide anything for us. Then another delay evidently a flight attendant was running late which delayed the flight another 20 minutes. Overall the Allegiant staff were unresponsive and unprofessional. We were given $100 vouchers for a future flight however at this point I keep asking what good they really are. So forward one week and we are doing the same. Flight for 6pm is delayed to 9.05pm the delayed to 10.50pm so if I actually do depart tonight we are in the same situation we were last Monday. It is now too late to get a flight tonight to Orlando. I am amazed at the lack of professionalism I have encountered with Allegiant.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,3,,,1,no

Allegiant Air,9,T Morgan,8th June 2014,I flew last month from Chattanooga to St. Pete FL. The flight there and back was great. Plane arrived on time friendly attendants. Online check in was easy and simple it made waiting in line a breeze. I flew with my daughter and did not pay extra to get assigned seats. I was nervous that we would be split up but each time we were placed together. The flight attendant coming back seemed confused about what gate and plane we were actually going to board at first but she figured it out. The plane looked new and spacious. The seats did not recline back but were bearable since the flight was only an hour. The security guard at the airport was very helpful in giving instructions to my ride. Overall I received great service for great price. I plan to definitely fly with them again and will recommend to my friends and family.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,2,G Ewoldt,5th June 2014,My daughter flew from Phoenix to MLI delayed to the next day . My wife flew from MLI to Phoenix / delayed 1.5 hr. My wife and I flew from Phoenix to MLI delayed 3.5 hrs. The flight to Duluth Minn had been scheduled for earlier that morning but the passengers were load and then deplaned. At 2.30 we were moved from our gate and the Duluth passengers were move to our gate and were loaded on our plane. That took about 1.5 hr. Once loaded the Duluth passengers were then deplaned again and told their flight had been cancelled. After they had been deplaned we were moved back to the gate we were originally scheduled for and finally loaded. This was 3.5 hrs after we were scheduled to take off for MLI. Now not only are the Duluth passengers angry but so are the return passengers waiting in Duluth. On top of that the MLI passenger are mad and so are the return passenger waiting in Moline which was originally scheduled for 8.30-9.00pm that evening. Unfortunately this is our only direct flight to Phoenix but no one should have to put with this kind of incompetence.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Dave Steele,27th May 2014,Fly Allegiant at your own risk. Extremely poor customer service from 30-minute-plus hold times on the phone to surly check-in agents. Terrible baggage policy charging for each check bag and carry-ons this is the US equivalent of Ryanair. No beverage service - unless you pay for it. No snacks - again unless you pay for it. Surprised they don't charge to use the lav. We had flown Allegiant several times as it was the most convenient for airports on either end both by ourselves and a couple times with the grandkids but the last time in Mesa-Gateway with the snotty desk agent was the last straw. She was clearly having a bad day and was determined to take it out on the flying public. When she announced - quite loudly to everyone in line - that our one bag was 3 lbs overweight and had to be lightened or we'd be charged $75 my mind was made up. I lightened the heavier bag adding the weight to the other. We then asked for a gate pass for the grandkids dad so he could see them off she again loudly exclaimed no not unless there's a medical reason.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,1,,2,no
Allegiant Air,2,Melissa Sentner,26th May 2014,"As the saying goes ""You get what you pay for"". Cheap flight was great. However do not purchase the shuttle from Allegiant directly as an add on. Book one yourself directly through a shuttle service. If you have any issues and try to call someone for help from Allegiant they will not assist you - they direct you to fill out an online form. And then the email response you receive will not even make sense. The service agent from the call center was rude to myself and the Resort Manager. They would not connect us to the customer service dept or their manager for help. Because of the horrible customer service that will be the last time I book anything through this company.",,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,1,,3,no

I explained to clerk I could not sit in an aisle seat I always traveled with a window seat and she tells me ""That's tough are you going to fly or not"". I didn't get that so called assigned seat after all but it was an aisle seat due to a to switch of planes for some reason but still charge for the seat. I had things in my one piece of luggage that would not be returning with me coming home so luggage would be lighter - when checking back in to go home I was 4 pounds overweight with less things. When boarding I was told to sit in row 31 and not 25 and got a window seat this time but paid for another seat - the man sitting in my so called paid seat refused to move.",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,8,Brenda Hiebert,21st May 2014,We have flown Allegiant 4 times now from Grand Forks ND to Sanford FL and have only had a delay once (our first time) due to a mechanical issue. The staff were very friendly and apologetic and after being delayed for 4 hours we actually arrived in Sanford in pretty good time. To people that are dissatisfied if there is a mechanical problem would you rather they discover it in mid-flight or would you rather have the delay? The money that we save with this airline is phenomenal and we will continue to use them as I think it is great value for the money.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,10,T Jarrett,19th May 2014,"Flew from to Niagara Falls to Sandford Florida and return. Both flights were somewhat on time (delayed a few mins leaving but arrived early at destination) and were smooth. Using the smaller airports is so much easier and more convenient.. All of the ""extras"" are subject to additional costs but on a 2 hour flight who really needs much more anyway. The flight down was aboard an old MD83 and the flight back was on a much newer Airbus A320. Good cheap non-stop flight and remember to read all the fine print and you will not be overcharged. Those complaining about ""Surprise"" charges did not read the disclaimers.",,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,2,Raymond Waugh,17th May 2014,I constantly fly Allegiant round trips Sanford to Concord. Ever since they changed the times of this route from Monday and Friday morning to Mon/Fri evenings you can absolutely count on it being delayed 1 hour or more because it comes from Harrisburg PA. Please put back to Mon/Fri morning please.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,2,yes
Allegiant Air,2,S Shields,16th May 2014,Find another airline to fly with. Sure the price is cheap but if anything goes wrong Allegiant does not do anything to help or compensate you. Our flight was delayed multiple times leaving us sitting in the airport for over 6 hours. Then after 6 hours of waiting Allegiant cancelled the flight. We received no compensation. Further when we arrived at the airport the next day we sat on the runway for an hour waiting to disembark and then another hour for our bags to come to the carousel. After sending an email to Allegiant expressing my frustration with the experience they offered no compensation or credit just a generic email that I had to wait 2 months for. Paying a more money for another airline is definitely worth it!,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,9,J Pattison,11th May 2014,"After reading reviews I was nervous about my upcoming flight from South Bend to Mesa. However my experience was very positive. I was very pleased with all Allegiant employees I encountered. The flight attendants were very helpful and friendly and would go above-and-beyond to help a customer. The plane's cabin was very clean well- kept and fairly comfortable. I was concerned about leg room so I up-graded to an exit seat for the trip there. However I did not have that option on the return trip but did not need the extra room. I am 6'3"" and had no issues with leg room or being comfortable. And yes there are no free snacks or drinks but their prices are extremely reasonable. I would rather pay a small amount for something I would like anyways. Overall I was very pleased with my experience and will fly Allegiant again. I hope Allegiant continues to expand to other airports and increase their routes.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,8,S Stadel,8th May 2014,We recently flew out of Bellingham to Las Vegas. The flight was on time crew were friendly I agree the seats are a bit uncomfortable but it's 2.5 hours so not a big issue. The only issue we had was on our return flight from Las Vegas we checked our bags at the airport at an outdoor kiosk and were told after our bags were taken that the fellows outside work on a tip only basis. We thought that was quite tacky and next time will check our bags at the counter inside. Overall though there were no issues worth mentioning and we would fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,10,Gari Colleen Zweigle,6th May 2014,Having read some of the reviews I was a bit worried when I booked my flight to Honolulu. We left on April 25th on time. The Allegiant reps and flight attendants were very nice. The seats were a bit tight. They didn't give me free peanuts and drinks but since I saved nearly 800 dollars per person I could overlook that. The flight back was on time flight attendants were very nice people were on staff to check us in.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,10,Amelia Cook,5th May 2014,We had a great flight today. It was our first time flying with Allegiant and felt it was a bit of a gamble having read some poor reviews but our flight today between Clearwater and Harrisburg PA was perfect. From the check-in person to the pilots and flight attendants I truly noticed an attention to customer service I was not expecting. It was little things like just being friendly and talking to us like humans not robots that made the biggest impact. It made me feel so glad we chose to give Allegiant airline a chance and look forward to doing so much more in the future. We knew in advance we would be paying extra for luggage and for drinks etc. The rates were still the best and only non-stop available. And the fact that the seats did not recline back was considered a plus by me.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,1,,5,yes

We waited in line for over an hour for hotel voucher. Next morning scheduled to leave at 10am on May 3 2014 boarded early and again with the mechanical problems. Finally boarded the third plane and arrived in Hunting 24 hours late.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,10,A Eliz,27th April 2014,Flew round trip out of Fort Wayne to Phoenix. This was the only airline close by that was affordable for entire family to fly. The flight left early both times boarding started 45 minutes before departure time and we were on the runway 5 minutes prior to departure time and arrived earlier. I did pay for 5 seats and a checked bag and still came out ahead. The kids used backpacks and my husband and I each had a small bag that we put under our seats. They may have eyed our bags but never measured or asked any questions. The check in desk attendants and flight crew were all very nice. This trip definitely can compare to flying Delta. The plane was MD-80 very clean and comfortable. I will fly them again. I highly recommend being at the gate and checked in ready to go at least one hour prior to departure they board early and quickly!,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,J Coleman,25th April 2014,I flew from Michigan to Phoenix in January. Our return flight was delayed multiple times and then cancelled with a rescheduled flight for the next day. That flight was also cancelled with no new flight schedule. We were forced to pay for another flight with a different airline. I would not recommend Allegiant unless you enjoy worrying your whole trip whether or not you will be able to return without booking another flight. In the end it cost me more to fly Allegiant.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,2,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,D Nelson,25th April 2014,We went from Greensboro to Sanford for a Spring Disney Trip. The staff was great from the check-in counter to landing. The flight attendants were very friendly. We had the same attendants on both flights and they remembered us and asked about our trip. The lady at check-in also told us that military doesn't have to pay for bags which saved me about $180. Overall great experience!,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,4,W Millett,25th April 2014,"Bought ticket online in February also paying for seats and a checked bag.

On check-in at GRR I learned that the aircraft had changed thus deleting that seat. This got resolved by agent. But it caused me some confusion and time trying to resolve. Allegiant website not user friendly. I chose Allegiant because of convenience of departure and arrival airports and the times. But in general we were not impressed by the service. Don't know if we saved versus another airline. Will compare next time.",,,Economy Class,,,4,3,1,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,4,L Duley,22nd April 2014,My husband and I fly with Allegiant very often but the past 4 or 5 times it has been delayed. I flew from Lexington to Orlando/Sanford on April 6 and the flight was delayed twice. The first time said it would be delayed by an hour and I thought ok I can deal with that. Then a couple hours later I received a text from Allegiant saying it was basically delayed by hours. Now keep in mind I paid more for a ticket to come in at an earlier time because my house is 2 hours away. We actually got in later than it I had paid for the cheaper ticket. I used to really like Allegiant but now I am wondering if I want to continue to fly with them or not. We usually fly at least 10 to 15 times a year.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,1,Kelly Naylor,22nd April 2014,Flight was delayed each way. Rude service. The flight attendant literally told one lady not to take too long to put her bag away in the overhead. The flight is cheap but they add on charges for everything. I guess you get what you pay for.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,5,A Kirk,22nd April 2014,Our second trip travelling with Allegiant and for the most part we are happy with our flights to first Hawaii and now San Diego. However travelling from San Diego on April 20 we were concerned with the lack of communication about gate location. Since we printed the boarding passes the night before we expected no firm boarding gate at that time. When we arrived at the airport without checked in baggage we went directly through security as we usually do. However past security on the airport monitors there was no reference to our flight at all. All other airlines had the gate and time of departure clearly listed. We walked the airports 40 plus gates looking for any indication of which gate we should depart from. We then asked airport staff and they could only suggest we find an Allegiant agent which we could not. Again all other airlines were clearly provided with gate and departure time but not Allegiant. Finally we called Allegiant customer service and were on hold for 30 minutes. The person we finally talked to was after some delay was able to provide a preliminary gate assignment but suggested it might change. When we finally did find it even the monitor at the gate indicated gate closed. Rather than relaxing before our flight the time past security was quite stressful and at time we wondered whether we were at the right terminal. Communication is very important to passengers. All it would likely taken was a quick call the airport staff to get the monitor situation corrected. We will fly Allegiant again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,10,Ian Hargraves,21st April 2014,Have flown many times with Allegiant and always expected some delays but never encountered one at all. Our fare from Orlando to Springfield MO was priced at $408 with Delta a 2 hour layover at Atlanta. We booked with Allegiant and paid just $110 round-trip and non stop. The aircraft was clean and flight attendants wonderful. I regularly travel from Orlando to Little Rock Springfield MO Newport News and Salisbury (now deleted) and thoroughly recommend Allegiant.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,Gary D Baumgartner,21st April 2014,My wife and I were scheduled to fly out of Bellingham Wa to Las Vegas on April 11 for the 9 am flight. An hour before departure we were told it would not be leaving until 3.30pm with no explanation or apologies (apparently there was a mechanical problem). We were given $8.00 food vouchers each and waited further delay until 3.45. Once on the plane it left as scheduled. We returned on April 18 as scheduled. The crew were friendly and professional but won't fly with them again as the their aircraft is old and unreliable not worth the savings!,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,Mark Merkel,21st April 2014,Flying out on Allegiant tomorrow and already this trip is a disaster. Confirmations have been difficult to receive went to check in online and wasn't able to add any bags. Went ahead and checked in to secure my seats and then called customer care. Told there was nothing more they could do. Told me that I would have to check my additional bags at the airport for a $50/bag charge vs. $20/bag online. She did offer to let me check my additional bags for my return trip but told me it was my tough luck on the outbound flight. She informed me however that I needed to be at the ticket counter 2 hours in advance and not the 60 minutes my e-mail confirmation said. Thankfully maybe I won't miss the flight but given all of the issues so far it will be the last trip for me on Allegiant. Pretty bad when you don't even have to take the trip to know that you won't be a returning customer.,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,5,J Camillo,19th April 2014,We flew Toledo to Sanford Feb 6th. Since we were the only flight going out that morning we breezed through security. Boarded the plane and sat. Finally the captain came on and explained we had to wait for the fuel truck to come back because we had not received enough fuel. Then we sat waiting for the paperwork. We finally took off 45 min. late not making up any time in the air. When we approached Sanford the captain came on again to inform us we now had to much fuel and would be circling the airport until we burned it off. 45 mins later we landed. All this plane does is fly back and forth between Toledo and Sanford. You'd think the fuel people would know exactly how much fuel is needed for each trip.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,,5,no
Allegiant Air,,Brian Lachance,14th April 2014,I have been flying between Orlando-Concord for the last 10 weeks. Not once have they been on time. People at Orlando/Sanford are rude and inconsiderate. They view selling you a ticket as a favor. Last flight into Florida tonight and as usual they are late.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,10,R Rohrer,14th April 2014,Flew round trip from Allentown to Orlando/Sanford. Was a little worried as I never herd of Allegiant before and that the planes are old but we had no problems and they were on time. I would use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,S Crownover,14th April 2014,"Abysmal. We were notified a mere hour before our flight that it had been delayed a full 25 hours and procuring vouchers for our hotel was like pulling teeth. Additionally Allegiant refused to cover the taxi fare that we had accumulated as a result of their screw-up. Their representative said that it should be ""good enough"" for us that they were ""accommodating [us] with a replacement flight!"" I spoke with a few travel representatives about this issue and they informed me that this sort of thing happens all the time with Allegiant.",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,T Connelly,14th April 2014,Was supposed to fly from Belleville IL to Sanford Fl. The weather was horrible in STL area and there were tornado warnings issued. It took me 3 hours to get to airport which would usually take 1.5 hours. I tried to call the airline to report that it was dangerous for me to travel but I was on my way. There was a 30 minute wait to speak with a human. When I arrived at the airport the plane was still there but they said that they closed the door already and could not let me on. The plane pulled out ten minutes early. I was standing there watching the plane pull away from the jetway. No refund no sorry we left early and didn't let you on. nothing. I will never use this airline ever. Terrible customer service.,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,9,T Cook,10th April 2014,We flew Concord to Orlando and back with Allegiant and we loved it. We were careful to read all the rules about baggage etc before we got to the airport so we had no issues there. Yes you do have to pay for even a soda on the flight but it was not a big deal. The flight was comfortable the attendants were nice the flight was a little delayed but not by much and certainly no worse than any other airline. I really don't get all the complaints I have seen on other reviews. I really liked Allegiant!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,P Gieschen,10th April 2014,Flew St. Petersburg/Clearwater to Rockford IL. on April 5. Flight 876 was delayed 2 hrs due to five attendants calling in sick. Once boarded we waited another 2 hours before the maintenance check and paperwork were done. Very poor management and unacceptable for a flight service.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,L Yardley,9th April 2014,I have flown with Allegiant only twice round-trip from SGF to AZA. Both times we were always on time or even somewhat early. They deliver exactly what you pay for. From the ground crew to the air crew they are all professional and very pleasant. I only hope they continue to grow and look forward to using them more as they add destinations.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,9,A Kant,7th April 2014,TUL to SFB flight and back after a weekend. The main motivation to use this airline was the affordable price and a direct flight to desired destination. We did our homework and were mostly pleased. This airline asks you to sacrifice comfort and charges less for it. If you demand extra they charge you extra. Have your boarding pass ready and be at the airport early. Print out your boarding pass as early as you can to get the best seats it is very important if you would like to sit with the person on the same reservation. Pack light. We just used the carry on allowed bag that has to fit under the seat. This also allows you to go straight to your gate. All check in bags and bigger carry on ones will be charged extra. The seats do not move but bring your own neck pillow. They allow a lunch pack and I had it with me so did not have to buy any food on the plane. Well I did buy a can of ice tea for $2. Bottle of water was also $2. Make sure you have an acceptable credit card for that. Restrooms are free! I did not like that the flights I took were both late. 30 and 45min. Not sure why. Seemed like that the first flight had been placed with the different plane (new airbus) since the seating arrangements were off and the second flight had some turbulent weather. Second plane was really old Douglas 80. Staff were nice and helpful. People do forget that this airline is different and demand the same service as on other airlines. Then they get frustrated if they get charged. I think I will fly again with them.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,1,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,8,R Ryan,6th April 2014,Flew yesterday with my family to Orlando for Spring Break and the flight was great when your on a budget this is the airline to choose. I read all the negative comments but every airline has delays. I fly for business at least once a week and I can't count how many times I have been delayed for numerous reasons. Direct flight was a big plus and Orlando/Sanford is an easy airport to get around in and you are out the door with your luggage in 20 minutes once you land. I will definitely use them again!,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,3,2,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,5,T Gallagher,3rd April 2014,We flew from Las Vegas to Honolulu on March 27 2014. Flight to Honolulu had no problems or issues at all it was on time and everything went smoothly at the airport. Follow their luggage guidelines and check in online and you won't have any problems. Flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas was delayed 4 hours 15 minutes but they did give each person in my family $16 in food vouchers to use at the airport the problem was because of the delay we missed our shuttle from the Las Vegas airport to the parking garage where our car was. When I asked an Allegiant employee for some suggestions she just said I would have to get a taxi. When I checked in online 24 hours in advance for our flight home I was able to check everybody in except for myself (we had 10 people total). I tried to check myself in online a few hours later and it worked fine I just didn't get to sit by my family during the flight. There is no inflight movie so bring something to do. The seats are super small and there is not much room. No food or drink not even water is given unless you pay for it with visa only no cash. We got extremely affordable flights to Hawaii and otherwise would not have been able to go if it weren't for price Allegiant offered. You give up luxury and service for affordable pricing which I think is fair.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,1,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,1,Frank Catano,1st April 2014,I recently traveled from Bangor to Punta Gorda. Upon check in you are asked to pay extra money to sit in preferred seats unimpressed considering these are 20+ year old aircraft not worth the money. Flight was delayed leaving Bangor due to an issues with the APU. Flight Attendants were uninformative rather sloppy looking the male purser became annoying by always telling people that he was from Hawaii and kept making rude comments about other passengers hardly professional. Landed late into Punta Gorda no apology for the delay just more lip from that annoying purser surprised he didn't break out into another Hawaiian song just so annoy us. Will never take this awful carrier again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,D Mohr,31st March 2014,Plane was supposed to leave Bellingham for Vegas at 9am and arrive at 11am. Mechanical problem's delayed flight until 12pm. At 12pm we were told our plane was flying to San Diego. This caused an uproar. We were told a plane was coming to get us at noon it didn't show up until 9.30pm. We arrived in Vegas at 1.30am Friday. A completely wasted day. Staff were not available for question's while we waited for hours. Allegiant's price for flying is the only bonus. Their entire staff are rude and don't seem to have a clue about how to treat a customer.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,,,,no
Allegiant Air,6,C Rupert,30th March 2014,I fly Bangor to Punta Gorda or Tampa/St Pete a lot. For what I save in cost I can't complain. However my attitude is that I am simply paying to get from point A to point B safely and on time - and at minimal cost. That always happens. I've had delayed flights on every airline I've ever flown - except Allegiant. That's simply a coincidence and it will surely happen eventually. It seems people can't wait to post bad news never the good. Allegiant specializes in low cost flights so don't compare them to airlines that hype about making your flight the highlight of your vacation. If you want to pay (a lot) extra for all the luxuries that's your choice - don't fly Allegiant.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,1,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Getz Bob,30th March 2014,Flew from Orlando to Lexington Ky on March 29 2014. Numerous problems from weather delay (understandable) to plane mechanical problems. All the time this was happening there was very little or no communication from the attendants. We were like wandering sheep trying to figure out where to go and what to do. Obviously little or no direction from management as to what to do when problems arise. I will never fly Allegiant again and urge others to consider the same. Flight scheduled to leave at 1.05pm finally left at 7.30pm. Pitiful.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Patsy Howard,30th March 2014,My grandson was to leave from Punta Gorda at 4.30 to fly to Fort Wayne Indiana and was delayed two times. Finally left at 8.30 pm. My niece just left today from Punta Gorda to also fly to Fort Wayne Indiana and was delayed 4 hours also. My sister is to fly from Fort Wayne to Punta Gorda tonight March 29 2014 and has been delayed four hours also. This is outrageous and I may never use Allegiant Air again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Thomas Cox,30th March 2014,We were set to fly out of Mesa at 6.45am. Did online check in the night before got in line to check bag at 5.55. After 20 minutes in line we got to the counter checked the bag and the woman said we were too late and would not make our flight! No last call from counter no indication of a problem and this is a very small airport! So we took our bag shot through security and they paged us over the intercom to get to the gate. We got to the gate at 6.25 20 minutes before take off time. We could see the plane there were approx 25 people still going up the steps and boarding. There was no agent at the gate we could not get out there! I ran to the next gate explained and asked her to let us out. She said no one was allowed out inside of the 20 minute deadline. At this point we were 17 mins out. In the end we stood there watching people board they plane take off and we were stuck! When I got back to the ticket desk the woman smiled and said the next flight to my town was in 2 weeks as all others were booked! We had to spend an additional $150 to catch a flight back 7 hours later to a city 2 hours from where we left our car! When we boarded this flight it was delayed because they were waiting for a passenger! She boarded at 1.55 for a flight set to leave at 2.05! We were furious.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,3,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,C Schaumburg,30th March 2014,"Flew to Bloomington IL to Sanford FL and likely wont use them again. Paid for carry-on carefully measured bags but made the mistake of stopping at the ticket counter where they said my bag didn't easily fit into the measurement device. Paid $50 extra for checked bag. Others who did not stop at ticket counter had much larger bags and were allowed to carry-on. No complimentary beverages - really? Return trip-although we paid for assigned seats our boarding pass did not have them spent couple hours night before to get them re-assigned only to be told upon boarding that we had to find our own seats - no apology - just ""you will be reimbursed"". We got differing information from every employee we spoke with regarding: extra baggage fees seating assignments how to indicate a lap child etc. Tried to use the Allegiant iPhone app which crashed and would not open. Signed up for text message regarding flights - never got a single one. Boarded almost an hour pre-flight and then sat in the plane without moving for over an hour - no explanation for the delay.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,9,Andy Wang,27th March 2014,Bellingham to Las Vegas round trip. Surprisingly the trip to KLAS was really smooth. Our personal item was a bit big width-wise but we got through no problem. Our plane arrived few minutes early the staff were professional and humorous (not expecting that) and the seats weren't that bad. The flight was really smooth. The trip back to KBLI was delayed by an hour because the incoming flight from Bellingham was delayed by the rain and even though the plane was parked in the gate both pilots were on the incoming flight. We made up some time because of strong tailwind (the pilots were trying hard to arrive a few minutes earlier). The pilots landed in the wind smoothly. The only thing I dislike about this airline is that you have to pay to select a seat even upon check-in. When you look at the price tag ($400 for 2 ppl round trip) all those pay drinks could be forgiven even the expensive carry-on. I think that you see all those negative reviews because people who had positive experience took it for granted (though really those delays are horrible to hear). I will travel with Allegiant again and hopefully Allegiant will train more professional crews.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,M Marie,26th March 2014,Flew from Clearwater St. Pete to Grand Rapids MI. Many people on the flight paid extra for reserved seating and had to sit where there were seats left. They said over the loud speaker that the seating was basically screwed up people who were assigned seat b were supposed to sit on seat c and so on and so on. The flight attendants were not really any help at all. In fact one of them seemed very irritated with the passengers that were complaining that they had paid extra for reserved seating. There were several boarding passes that had duplicate seating. Some passengers gave up their seats so families could sit together. After we boarded the plane we backed out from the gate and sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes before we took off. No explanation. Oh but they gave us free bottles of water and a mini pretzel bag. I guess that was supposed to make up for it.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,N David,24th March 2014,"Months ago I purchased a flight from Allegiant for this morning checked in for my flight online last night and loaded the boarding pass on my phone with Allegiant's app. I had no bags to check so I was ready to go. When I got to the security check point the app crashed and as it died it took my boarding pass with it. OK. I went to the Allegiant ticketing counter told them the app crashed and even after I connected to wi-fi it would try to ""reload"" but failed every time and that I needed a boarding pass. They said that it was impossible that boarding had started and no agent computer or app could produce a boarding pass now. 30 minutes before my flight was supposed to leave they started paging my name. This was a small airport TSA had no line the gate was around the corner. I could see the person paging my name. Unless your travel is strictly leisure and it doesn't matter at all if you get to your destination not avoid Allegiant like a plague. Cheap is nice until cheap fails.",,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,M Malnourie,24th March 2014,We were supposed to leave Bismarck ND on Sunday March 23rd at 12.50 pm. We were all loaded and sat at the terminal for 15 minutes when the captain came on and said we would not be going to Las Vegas in this plane. They would try to fix this one or send another from Las Vegas. Two hours later told us this flight had been cancelled. Nobody with Allegiant would talk or offer any explanation. They offered a phone number that said to go to the website. That's it. After finally getting the info from the website it says we will leave the next day after another Allegiant flight. We should be leaving before that flight.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,Michael Shirchenko,22nd March 2014,Flew from Niagara Falls to Sanford. Flights were on-time. No frills airlines but additional charges were excessive. Normal checked baggage with other airlines is 50lbs. With these guys its 40lbs. Had to pay additional $150 for overages. Convenience has a price tag other than that I would fly with someone else.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,2,,4,no

On March 18 I received an email that all flights to Newport news were cancelled for the month of March. I was left scrambling to book a new ticket on another airline. No help from Allegiant customer service booking at short notice on another airline was expensive. No explanations for the cancellation and no concern for my situation. The flight was to my daughter's wedding. I have never had an experience where you booked a ticket and the airline cancelled without offering options to get you to your destination.,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,T Cook,19th March 2014,We flew the Charlotte to Orlando route and had a great experience both ways. The flights were a little delayed but no worse than any other airline and one delay was truly weather related. You do have to pay for every bag soda and snack on the flight but the flight was literally 1/3 the price of other airlines so I didn't mind spending $13 for a bag or $3 for a soda. Flight attendants were nice flight was comfortable...no complaints here.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,Donna Olah,18th March 2014,Flew back from Las Vegas to Grand Forks ND. Flight # 484 March 15th. If you want your holiday plans ruined then fly Allegiant. Their planes are overused and mechanical failures are often and cause delays each time that I flew. When you check in they treat you with disrespect. They charge you extra for service that is non-existent and you sit cramped in tiny seats with no circulation to your legs. Staff are very rude and have no people skills. Be prepared to pay extra for carrying a small tote handbag on board.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,N Taylor,17th March 2014,PSI-BLI flight 211 16th March. Late 50% of the time. Fly 40+yr old DC10's. Online info wrong and outdated.

You pay for what you get - will never fly with them again!,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,C Wildman,17th March 2014,"Flight from Bloomington IL to Orlando-Sanford FL on 3/13/14. Walked up to the check-in counter line 50 minutes prior to our flight. The man in front of us had been given a card that said he was going to be the last person to check-in and the Allegiant representative yelled at me and my 2 daughters across the crowd of 30 people to say ""You missed your flight."" She ended up letting us check in without even trying to carry on our bags (which were all within the size limits!) charging us $50 each and when we went to board no one else had boarded yet either. She eventually came to the boarding counter with the other representatives and made a comment to me that it must have been my ""lucky day.""

Allegiant Air,10,R Eaton,17th March 2014,I have flown this airline numerous times and my experience has been similar. However this week I flew on 3/10 from Asheville to Punta Gorda and 3/14 back. Both flights took off and landed on time with no hassles.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,10,Bill Duston,17th March 2014,This is probably my seventh or eighth round-trip between Greensboro and St. Pete. Like all the other flights I was very pleased with Allegiant. Their flight crews are quite professional yet very friendly the planes are new and are usually quite clean. Both flights this time were either on time or just a few minutes late. Yes you pay for everything. But I find that everything is explained on their website. I will continue to fly with Allegiant in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,10,K McCarthy,17th March 2014,We flew from Syracuse to Clearwater and after reading all the bad reviews we were very nervous as to what to expect. We flew with 3 small children during the March Break too. The customer service on both ends was excellent the staff were very friendly and accommodating with our children. The check-in line was quick and efficient on both ends. Our flight was delayed on the way down for an hour but once the plane arrived we quickly boarded and were up and away. Complimentary water and pretzels were given and the flight was smooth and quick. I would totally fly this airline again and as a family of 5 discount rates during the March Break a non-stop flight and small lineups beat a larger airline with more frills any day!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,C Root,14th March 2014,Unexplained major delays from KDSM to KDPG. Agents tell different accounts for delays. No consistency. The delays are apparently occurring in Punta Gorda as they are the planes that make the return trip to Florida arriving at midnight 1-2am well after the advertised ETA of 10pm. If you can't make routes work consistently then get out of the market!,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,8,J Balemans,13th March 2014,Flew to St. Pete's from Bangor (return) - no issues on the flight there. Flight home was delayed 1 hour which was not a big deal. Complimentary water and pretzels provided due to the delay. Staff were friendly and things were kept very simple.

Allegiant Air,,J Duffy,12th March 2014,"Got to airport 2.5 hours before scheduled flight. Waited to board only to be offered a ""complimentary drink"" (soda or water) while we waited for a mechanical issue to be resolved. 1.5 hours after our flight was supposed to leave we were told it was canceled with no explanation or apology. They have no agreement with another airline to assist when this kind of thing happens. We were ""put up in a hotel"" by the airline because we lived more than 50 miles from the airport. We were told to check online for when our flight would be rescheduled. Our ""new"" flight was scheduled 30 hours later. On our return flight we were not ""allowed"" to check our bags until two hours before the flight. That time came and went and multiple flights by Allegiant were canceled or delayed while we stood in line.

Allegiant Air,,C Rupp,12th March 2014,As a frequent traveler flying every 7 to 10 days I will never purchase a flight on this airline again. At best on time flights record is 50/50. Customer service is the worst I have seen. No information to passengers that might allow for alternate travel plans no concern for elderly or families with children no consideration of food or beverage needs with 5+ hour delays many delayed flights arriving after midnight with no rental car service plus many other complaints including a ridiculous customer service phone line with up to two hour waits for a representative who is not empowered to provide even a small amount of customer service. Many more issues. Strongly advise not risking travel plans with this airline. With all this said actual flight crews have been very nice and professional.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Susan Murray,11th March 2014,March 3 from Bellingham to Palm Springs with my 87 year old mother. Flight was originally set to 3.45 delayed to 7.45 then moved ahead to 6.45. People were scrambling to get to the airport for the 6.45 departure. Ended up waiting in the waiting room for the crew to arrive. They showed up for the 7.45 flight. We didn't board the plane for another hour. Then sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes while they re-booted the system twice. Finally towed back to the gate and boarded another Allegiant jet that had been sitting there all the time. By the time we arrived in Palm Springs around 1.00am the car rental counter was closed. The night before our return flight on March 7 we were text to say the flight on Friday was delayed back to Bellingham. By this time I had been trying to get hold of Allegiant on the customer service # - the waits on my cell phone were over 30 minutes. We did not want to risk dragging our mother all over the airport having the flight delayed again or worse cancelled and having to figure out what to do! I finally got hold of Allegiant and cancelled our return flight. We got one-way tickets on Alaska to Seattle and had one of the husbands pick us up and drive us back to Bellingham.

All flights prior to us were delayed when we checked in. Approx 30 min prior to departure I received about 3 texts delaying flight hour by hour until 9.45. Then the gate agent announced that due to shuffling of aircraft our flight was delayed until midnight. They announced we could leave airport and return later. I never did receive a text about the last delay and the website never reflected this either. In the meantime every flight scheduled after us departed either delayed slightly or on time. We then found out Allegiant hired a Sun Country flight to pick up passengers first in PIA and bring them to Punta Gorda and then take us home. This flight arrived at 12.00 am. We were then held off from boarding for another 1 hour as we waited for them to deplane 3 more flights that had arrived shortly after our plane. We in finally took off at 1.45 am. Paid for seat and because aircraft was different it was changed to open seating. Staff ordered pizza for everyone and provided soft drinks and water. I can understand delays like this if weather is bad. Difficult to watch several flights fly out that were scheduled after us. Very true you get what you pay for.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,J Peters,7th March 2014,"Las Vegas NV to Grand Forks ND I arrived at the terminal 2 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart. I had checked in online prior to arriving at the airport so that all I would have to do was drop my bags. I was herded into a pen with hundreds of other Allegiant travelers and subjected to an Allegiant Airline agent who took great joy in yelling at everyone to check-in online so that they could be fast-tracked to a different holding pen. Many of us tried to explain that we had already done so prior to arriving at the airport - but it was to no avail. Eventually (25 mins later) we were divided into two lines. One for those of us who had checked in online and one for travelers who had not. Standing in this new line the same agent began yelling for travelers who were supposed to be going to various destinations - supposedly in order of departure time. Those travelers were fast- tracked to the front of the online check-in line regardless of whether they had actually checked-in online or not. Even though some of those travelers were ""fast-tracked"" - many missed their flights. I ended up playing dumb and getting in line with some people who were leaving on a flight that was scheduled to depart before mine - just so that I would not miss my flight too. When I got to the counter the agent I dealt with lectured me for being late and wrote ""late"" all over my boarding pass and bag tag. I ran to security and then on to my gate just to make it in time. I have no idea how many missed the flight. Next time I fly - I will be looking at all other airline options before I even consider Allegiant.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,3,David Macvey,7th March 2014,Scheduled to fly Bellingham to Honolulu (7pm) on Feb 17 2014 and sat in the departure gate and listened to a few delay messages before the staff member at the gate desk vanished. An hour later I went searching for an Allegiant rep to update us. Then told the flight was cancelled - rumour had it that the flight crew did not have sufficient hours to complete the journey. This stranded a full plane load of passengers. I can understand and support the safety reasons that support the crew not flying but I think this indicates very poor management. We were provided hotel accommodation and flew out the next day at 12 noon. We and many others lost the prepaid hotel payments for the night of the 17th we did not show.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,5,Ian McCallum,7th March 2014,March 3 scheduled flight from Palm Springs to Belingham. The rescheduled flight departed as advertised on March 4 and landed on time. Some apologies from airline staff about previous day's snafu but no explanations tendered. On arrival at Bellingham I learned from other sources that there had been many cancellations due to ground fog and poor visibility at Bellngham airport. If this was indeed the reason for Allegiant's problems the previous day they never mentioned it. Returning March 6 from Bellingham online check-in didn't work for me forced to wait in line for nearly an hour to get boarding pass. Actual flight left and arrived on time no untoward events. If Allegiant was more forthcoming keeping its clients properly informed of what was happening they could save a lot of the ill will and frustration they engender among their clients when things go wrong. My previous recommendation stands: if you want cheap fares and time is not pressing they're ok otherwise choose a more expensive and hopefully more customer-friendly airline such as WestJet.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,1,Chris Brisson,6th March 2014,Scheduled on 2/17/14 to fly from Newport News to Orlando/Sanford at 5.46pm. At 4pm we received a message the flight was delayed followed by information it was on time for departure. Checked in and then notified it was delayed an hour. We then had 3 more delays and by 11pm we were ready for boarding. It got worse from there as the flight crew walked off the job. They had to piece a crew together for the flight to Newport News. So we then boarded the aircraft they announced we needed to hurry up or they would not fly. This was just frustrating by this point seemed rude way to approach the situation when they were at fault for the longer then expected delays. 7 days later we were set to return at Orlando/Sanford it was really disorganised at check in and you could only check in when they announced they would allow you to do so. Last but not least we were able to check in we had 1.5 hours until departure and decided to have lunch. Then we got notification our flight was delayed. After a 2 hour delay we boarded and the pilot apologized for the delay. Sometimes you pay for what you get and don't understand how they are still in business. Poor communication rude from my experience and how they treated other customers.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,N Lewis,6th March 2014,I was involved in the debacle that was at the Bellingham Airport the week of Feb 23rd due to the snow. Allegiant has poor communication terrible customer service hold times of 2 hours or more when calling on the phone flight text alerts do not work to tell you that the flight is delayed/canceled. Flights still said on-time when checking online even though they were delayed or canceled once you got to the airport and were waiting in the terminal. They will not pay for hotel accommodation. Spent a total of 18 hours waiting at the airport in regards to the departing flight as well as the flight back to Bellingham. The funny thing was the whole time Allegiant was scrambling around trying to figure out what they were going to do Alaska Airlines flights were all having no problems landing and getting off the ground. This is by far the worst travel experience I have ever had.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,Jeremy Laxton,6th March 2014,Flight 729 Little Rock to Orlando March 2 2014. We arrive at the airport early to find out that our flight is delayed. No one can give us any answers on the status of our flight. Our original flight was suppose to depart at 5.50pm we were finally able to board at 10pm. Once we boarded the plane they made us wait while they de-iced the plane. After 45 mins we push back from the gate to be de-iced. We wait another 30 mins for the de-ice truck. After a 2 or more hour wait we are brought back to the gate to de-plane. This takes another 30 mins or more before the her bridge is even brought to our plane. Once off the plane all they tell us is sorry be back tomorrow morning at 10am our flight is scheduled to depart at noon. They do not tell us which baggage claim our bags will be located we just have to wonder around baggage claim until we find it. This is another long wait. The next morning we are notified that our flight is delayed from departing at noon to now at 4.30pm. We have now lost 2 of our vacation days money spent on hotels and money on rental cars. You may pay more with other airlines but you will have a better chance making it to your final destination.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,J Jerger,5th March 2014,I flew last month and the experience was not pleasant. The flight from St. Petersburg/Clearwater FL to Greenville SC was scheduled to leave at 9am. The evening prior to our departure we received an electronic communication of the flight being delayed to 1pm. I was appreciative of the communication until I showed up to the airport only to find that the flight was delayed again until 3.30. This time I received no communication and the board at the airport as well as their website still showed a 1.00 departure time. As if that wasn't enough after paying for a seat assignment they could not honor it due to using a different plane. So it became open seating. Unfortunately it appears from their rude demeanour the ground staff do not care about their customers. The only bright spot was the flight crew! They were very good to passengers! All in all I may have to fly from a different airport in the future which is sad because I frequent this area and prefer the regional airport but if Allegiant cannot be more dependable then I will fly an airline that cares about my business.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,4,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,7,L DelVecchio,5th March 2014,"Fly from MDT to Orlando/Sanford. Check in was a little rough due to no one delegating which line was the line for people who already checked in vs people just arriving and not checked in ahead of time. Flight left on time. Seats weren't anything special but it's an airplane not your living room sofa. Flight attendants were helpful and nice. The airline is a discount airline so you're going to get charge for the ""frills"". You get a discounted ticket but you're going to end up paying for the extra stuff right down to the seating and bags. Our flight back to MDT was delayed 2 hours but the weather was bad that day with snow up North and thunderstorms down South. Not much anyone could do with that setback. All in all I'd use them again and even suggest it to people I know could handle it.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,5,D Smith,5th March 2014,Feb 28 return Mar 3 2014 Springfield MO to Clearwater/St Petersburg FL. Outward leg on an Allegiant A320. Brand new seats but seats very uncomfortable and small seat pitch. Very small tray table not even large enough to hold a laptop and a beverage at the same time. These seats are perhaps the worse seats I have encountered. Slight delay due to computer errors pilots had to reboot the computers. Three delayed flights arrived same time in St Petersburg and our luggage did not arrive in the terminal for an hour and 20 minutes. Return on Miami Air International- sub contracting for Allegiant. 737-800 aircraft better seats and room plus given bottled water pretzels and cookies. No issues on return flight.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,Ian McCaalum,5th March 2014,Booked to fly PSP-BLI Mar 3 on flight 211 leaving 7.12 arriving 10pm. Received recorded phone call and email that morning that there would be 4 hour delay flight would now arrive at 2 am. Later same day received further phone / email that departure time changed to 10.15 from previous 11.15pm. On arriving at waiting lounge at 9.15pm found departure now back to 11.15. Eventually announcement about cancellation made over PA system. Two harassed and overworked employees dealt reasonably well in the circumstances explaining about replacement flight next day and providing overnight accommodation to those who needed it. I have frequently travelled Allegiant in the past but have suffered two very bad delays so far in 2014. Their planes are old and possibly more subject to mechanical defects their spare planes and aircrews are few ground support staff are seldom to be seen and apparently not well informed on operational problems. Allegiant's prices are cheap if you are traveling light and prepared to put up with frequent and lengthy delays but if dependable service is what you want pay up and go elsewhere.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,1,S Toop,5th March 2014,March 4 2014 - we returned from trip to Las Vegas on Allegiant it was a 2 day delay going down and a 5 hour delay on the return. I have never had such bad service. Do not be fooled by the cheap prices they don't care about the passengers and are only there for the money. Our vacation was ruined as we lost 2 days of our trip. When we finally got on board after waiting over 40 hours they would not even pay for our drinks.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,9,Wilson Ray,5th March 2014,We travelled to Punta Gorda Fl. on Feb 10th and returned Feb 28th.

Allegiant Air,3,J Long,3rd March 2014,Flew back from Mesa on one of their newer larger planes. The seats were the most crowded and most uncomfortable I have endured! In theory Allegiant is convenient and affordable but the reality is that they nickle and dime you to death miss scheduled times on a regular basis and now abuse and insult their passengers with terrible seating!,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,3,R Morris,26th February 2014,Allegiant is a budget airline and the old saying that you get what you pay for applies. We were delayed 2 days and they made us sit in the airport for hours before finally cancelling and only send an email to tell you the rescheduling time. They also don't tell you that email is how you will be notified. The flight attendants chew gum when serving people which looks highly unprofessional. When you try to call to rebook you can expect a long hold. I found some of the agents to be very helpful and others not. It would have to be a pretty huge saving for me to pick this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,2,,4,no

Allegiant delayed the flight until 8.30pm then cancelled the flight. The next flight was rescheduled for Saturday 16th February one day after our ship left port! We had to drive our car 12 hours to Fort Lauderdale to make our cruise which we did! Our drive back was uneventful allowed us to overnight in Savannah GA thank goodness because the return flight to Asheville was delayed we made it back home before the plane did!

Allegiant Air,,R Morrissey,24th February 2014,"Flight 645 to Sanford FL 4 hours late. ""Crew"" issues apparently. Got in so late that the Avis counter was about to close after waiting for us well beyond their closing time. Flight 644 back home. Another 3 hours late. Heard crew and/or weather related issue. First and last time I fly this mess of an airline. I was excited that they offered an inexpensive direct flight to Florida. Now I know why. Talking with others in the terminal (customers as well as non-Allegiant terminal staff) I learned this is the norm for them.

I have flown many times with Allegiant and not once have they been on time. The least amount of time that the flight was delayed 3 hours. I have learned my lesson with Allegiant. Expect nothing. Rude service extremely long check-in lines horrible seats nothing not even a bottle of water is free. I am actually scheduled to fly today. Flight 803 10.47am.

Allegiant Air,8,G Schurman,24th February 2014,My husband and I travelled to Florida from Bangor recently on an Allegiant flight. Staff friendly and everything else was very satisfactory. We were leaving in poor weather so the plane had to be de-iced. That meant our departure was delayed for one hour. When we compared the cost of flights from other departure points and with other airlines there was no comparison for value for money. And the fact that the trip was non-stop was a real bonus. We would definitely fly Allegiant again!,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,David Jay,20th February 2014,We flew from Bellingham to Palm Springs over the Christmas holidays. It snowed the day we were leaving we made it to the airport okay for the morning flight and waited for them to clear the runway. Allegiant kept delaying all day and in the end cancelled the flight. We had to spend almost 2 hours on the phone waiting for customer service to book us on a flight the next day which left in the afternoon. Again delayed over an hour and so we lost two days of our vacation. On the way back from Palm Springs we were delayed a couple of hours as well. The line to check in was ridiculous. Every other airline has multiple agents and no line-up.. Allegiant one or two agents and over an hour line-up (both ways). On the way down we were a couple of lbs. over the limit with the check-in luggage and they said no problem. On the way back they said even if you're 1 lb. over you have to take something out or they'd charge us. This is the one and only time I will ever fly with them.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,D Johnson,18th February 2014,"Holiday trip a real bust on Allegiant Air. Our departure was delayed two hours from Youngstown to Punta Gorda. The snack bar and restaurant at the airport were closed. When the flight finally departed there were no snacks or food left on the aircraft due to the lateness and not taking the opportunity to restock. The seating is uncomfortable. I'm 6'3"" and my knees were banging on the seat ahead of me the entire flight. The seatbacks do not recline so you are stuck in a stiff upright posture the entire flight. It's like riding in a cattle car. I will not fly this airline again.",,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Garth McAlister,17th February 2014,This is without a doubt the worst airline I have been on. The aircraft was filthy the flight attendants surly and rude and the service awful. The aircraft took off from Las Vegas bound for Bellingham without an adequate fuel load and we had to land in Portland to refuel. I will never fly this airline again and encourage others not to as well. I would rather pay twice the fare that Allegiant charges and have a pleasant flight feel safe and not have to tolerate rude and surly flight attendants.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,A Scot,17th February 2014,Recently flew out of PIE. Surprisingly we left on time even arrived early. Even though they said we had a tailwind behind us I think it was more like less planes traveling that day because of a snowstorm. I had the time for this flight and was actually prepared for their tardiness and was pleased to be on time for once! Would recommend because of price but be prepared to be late.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,1,D Berens,17th February 2014,We were scheduled to leave Grand Forks to Sanford Orlando on January 27th. We had a storm to drive through and highways were closed. We managed to reach the airport with little sleep and were boarded on our plane at 10.30am. We were onboard but were then taken off the plane due to a flat tyre. They told us they would try to fix the issue and then we were told that we were going to fly out that day. After waiting at the airport until 3.30pm they told us the flight was cancelled until the next day. They put us up in a hotel but only one room per booking. We were told we would leave at 8am then got bumped to 8.30am! Not impressed! Not sure if I would fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,1,1,,1,no

The flight home was delayed 7 hours then cancelled until the next day. When he arrived at the airport in plenty of time there was no-one at the desk. He didn't have a boarding pass because there wasn't an option to print it for that flight. The airport customer service called the gate and told them a passenger was waiting - they said they would come and get him. No-one came - he missed his flight. To top if off the next flight out was 2 days later. I was told by the central office that they do not have a reciprocal arrangement with other airlines and there was ""nothing they could do"". The low prices may be appealing but in the end you end up paying more. Good discount airlines are a great alternative but Allegiant Air has missed the mark.",,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,2,no

The last 3 flights I've taken with them have followed a similar pattern: 2 4 6 hour delays then cancel and re-book the next day. My sense is that they've grown too fast and their infrastructure can't keep up with their flights but it ultimately comes down to poor management. It's too bad - this was an excellent convenient flight. I'm now forced to look at other options.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,1,no

I get to the airport at 1 to have them tell me the plane hasn't left PIE (Clearwater) yet. We then didn't board until 4.45 sat on the plane until 5.30 until we finally took off. They served us 1 slice of cold pizza. We finally touched down at 8.30. I have a return ticket for this Thursday I purchased a ticket to fly United instead. Staff not friendly either.

It was perhaps the best airline experience I have had in decades. The reservation process was excellent with the site being easy to navigate and all details being clearly explained. We paid for pre-assigned seats and for one carry-on each. We printed out our boarding passes prior to arriving at the airport and everything was a breeze. We had early arrivals and the flight was comfortable. I will definitely travel through Allegiant Air in the future when going to Florida.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,,5,yes

AZA to GTF delayed at least 4 hours and counting. Weather fine at both ends of flight. Obviously no backup crews. Communication of delays is poor.

They did offer refreshments and food voucher after 2 hours of waiting.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,Nicole Barker,4th February 2014,"If you believe the prices are too good to be true thats because they are! The last time I flew with them I was stuck in Punta Gorda for over 8 hours at the airport. They said the plane had a malfunction and that they had sent for another plane. The other plane never showed and they finally fixed the plane we were supposed to travel on almost 9 hours later. Today I was supposed to fly from Asheville to Punta Gorda. I received 5 different text messages delaying the flight hour by hour. Finally when I did not receive a text and the plane was supposed to leave at 2.20 I went to the airport only to find out that the plane that was supposed to pick us up had not even left Punta Gorda yet due to ""cloud coverage"". Allegiant did not notify any passengers of this until they all arrived at the airport thinking the flight was finally on time. After about an hour I received a text stating that the flight was cancelled but with no time or information on when or if it would be rescheduled. I would much rather pay the extra money to travel with an airline you can trust.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,K Delliveniri,3rd February 2014,I have been at the airport since 6.45am. There are roughly 6 planes worth of people stuffed into an airport meant to hold 2 planes worth. There are no restaurants just a snack shop in the corner that ran out of sandwiches 2 hours ago they do serve alcohol which isn't really making it's patrons calmer. All of the chairs are full and people are occupying the floor and every standing and leaning space. I believe there is only one bathroom but if I get up to investigate I might lose my seat. The only information booth with actual people is located outside of security so we are all essentially trapped in the terminal. Details are being delivered through an intercom system run by unapologetic staff. They assure us there is no new information and that our planes are unable to land at the airport because of cloud cover or leave their prior destinations because of rain.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,K Jones,3rd February 2014,Round trip from Spokane WA to Honolulu HI was late 3+ hours each way. All delays were caused by Allegiant.

No coffee tea or water glad I had brought my own. We were a little late taking off because of de- icing. Upon coming back I was only a few lbs over with my luggage but got charged 50 dollars.

Finally left Allentown and told it would be 3 hours to Punta Gorda. 4 hours later we were descending into Punta Gorda almost ready to land and the plane suddenly started climbing again 1 hour later we were told that it was too foggy to land at Punta Gorda and we didn't have enough fuel to hang around and wait for it to clear so were going to land in St Petersburg.

When they got to Punta Gorda FL. they wouldn't land and flew up to St. Pete FL. Finally put them on buses and bussed them back to Punta Gorda FL. They were not told what was going on and had no food or drinks and were made to stay on the plane. Arriving in Punta Gorda FL. at 11.30 pm. No one told the people waiting to pick the passengers up what was happening and if asked one person would tell you thing and someone else would tell you something different.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,R Eaton,31st January 2014,Have flown Allegiant about 12 times and have had only 1 on time departure. Our last flight was 1/26 from PIE to AVL. Over 5 hours late. Equipment issues. Worst part is that even though it had an Allegiant flight # it was flown by Falcon Air. Both plane and crew were Falcon. When we checked in we were told that it was a chartered flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,Gail Driscoll,30th January 2014,Flew Moline IL to Punta Gorda (or tried to) on 1/27/14. Half hour before landing announcement made we cannot land because of fog and are being routed to Sanford FL. Cannot land at another airport because not enough gas. Land at Sanford airport closed staff had to be called in. Told we would be getting hotel room only to really find out that we would be paying for the room because it was weather-related. 180 some people for 40 hotel rooms doesn't add up - a lot of whom were elderly. Most of us left on our own at Sanford airport with nothing slept on floor. No food or beverages offered. No customer service. Rented car when rental agency opened and drove to Fort Myers. Will not be flying Allegiant again!,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,Vestal David,29th January 2014,"Original flight out on Allegiant #1065 January 17 was eventually cancelled and we never actually flew it. We returned on Allegiant #1064 on January 23. Allegiant Air 757-200 servicing Spokane is not equipped with necessary technology to land in regions frequent foggy conditions. Allegiant misinforms customers of flight status when you can find out what is actually going on with your flight using FlightAware. Allegiant kept moving out the ""delay"" in two hour increments up to four hours after the flight had left the diverted airport for the return to the destination never actually arriving in the departure city.",,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,R Ohlson,28th January 2014,I travel from Appleton WI to Orlando/Sanford FL at least two to three times a year and I always have a pleasant experience.

Allegiant Air,1,A Scot,28th January 2014,Maiden trip from PIE to SWF on 10/31/13. On time definitely a no frills airline. Stewards and stewardesses complained the whole trip about having a 4hr layover. Now the return trip: My flight was scheduled for a timely departure! Approx 7.30pm that meant being there by 5.30. Never received text alert and airport screens showed on time schedule. An announcement was finally made at 7.15pm of the delay we would hopefully be boarding after it arrived at gate at 9.15-9.30. After arriving after midnight I still had a 2 hr drive home. I can usually fly back and forth with just a personal item but rudeness is unacceptable. Everything is an added fee: seat water snack carry on checked bag priority seating etc.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,Gilbert Jonathan,28th January 2014,I recently flew from Greenville to Clearwater and both legs the plane left three hours late with weather not being a factor.

Allegiant Air,,S Anderson,24th January 2014,Honolulu to Las Vegas flight was delayed we boarded the plane sat for over an hour on the plane had to deboard the plane wait 2 more hours and was eventually told the flight was rescheduled for the following morning. The next morning we sat on the plane over an hour for fuel before take off. Flights appear to have delays/cancellations for some reason and customer service department is horrible. Not a customer friendly airline and troubles are not worth the initial savings since you usually end up spending more in the end with unreliable flights.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Susan Scarbrough,23rd January 2014,Punta Gorda to Knoxville on Jan 9th 2014. Flight was delayed 3 hours to start off with then after 2 hours of waiting we were sent to another part of the airport to wait after the 3 hour delay we were told the flight had been cancelled. Had to find another ride back home which is a good 45 minute drive. They said it would be rescheduled for 6am the next morning. After arriving at the airport at 4am the next morning the flight was delayed again and we finally boarded 2 hours later then left for Knox. We got over Orlando and we had to turn around and go back to the airport. Finally get to Knox then we have no gate for the plane to go into so we sat on the runway for about an hour. This experience was unacceptable and very costly if you consider the cost of 2 trips back and forth to the airport. Trip back was not as bad but also a delay. Yes the flights are very reasonable but just be prepared for delays.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,2,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,J Matthews,21st January 2014,"Booked the first flight in the morning out of Las Vegas (8am). When we arrived we were told our flight would be delayed a few hours they didn't know how long and offered us $10 in food vouchers? By noon they were still unsure and said they ""may"" have a plane coming at 2pm but that was not a certainty. I told them I needed to be home and asked about the 2.30 pm flight. The response was that I could change but would have to pay and it would cost $1600 to do that. When I returned 12 min later the desk was swamped and she was giving away the seats she had just told me I would have to buy for $1600! I asked for my checked bag back so I could use another airline she stated that she did not have any staff to retrieve the bag! After no communication and other Allegiant flights we finally got a plane 9 hours later. They actually closed down the desk after an hour of people asking what was going on and when we may possibly get out. The new plane was small and it was all open boarding. We had originally paid for seats and priority boarding. When we were all on there was 2 people without seats as they had ""miscounted"" the seats in the new plane! They actually asked if anyone would give up their seats for a $25 voucher for another trip.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,C Campbell,20th January 2014,Flight from Punta Gorda to Moline cancelled 2 hours before flight time. No reason given. Good weather at both airports for flight. Likely due to lack of crew and/or equipment. I intend never to use again.,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,1,no

Allegiant Air,9,Ryan Glanzer,14th January 2014,"I flew from Austin to Las Vegas on a Thursday and returned on a Sunday. I had nothing but positive experiences the entire time. The $55 airfare was a steal compared to the other airlines which made it pretty easy to overlook fees for luggage and seat selection. I am 6'6"" so I paid $21 each way to sit in the exit row (31st row) in the aisle and I had at least five feet of space in front of me. The flights started boarding an entire hour before scheduled take-off which I guess was nice. Both flights left exactly on time and both arrived to their destination ahead of schedule. I would definitely fly Allegiant Air again.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,2,M McKenzie,9th January 2014,Returning from Las Vegas on Jan 6 2014. Got to the Las Vegas airport and was told the flight was delayed by 4 hours due to pilot being timed out. Does Allegiant never have any stand by staff? By the looks of the gate that day all Allegiant flights were very delayed. The weather was fine so very little in the way of excuses for them. I doubt I will ever fly Allegiant again as this is the 3rd time with problems.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,3,Patty Murphy,9th January 2014,A group of 5 of us paid $145 total to be able to select our seats.

Allegiant Air,,Dayna Dittmar,7th January 2014,Flight 210 leaving Bellingham at 9am going to Palm Springs CA. Got to the airport at 7.30 am and was told the flight was on time even though it was snowing. Got into the boarding lounge and told it was delayed until 10am due to the snow and runway not being clear. At 10am it was still not flying with little updates. By 3 pm when I checked the flight status online it showed it was cancelled. Went up to ask the staff and was told no the flight will go out as soon as they have clearance to fly. After they cancelled 3 flights due to apparent weather and gave us a phone number to call to be put on the next flight.

Allegiant Air,,A Zawko,7th January 2014,My son's wedding was in Florida on Jan. 4 2014 so we booked our flights (6 family members) in August for this special occasion. We were scheduled to fly from Knoxville to St. Petersburg/Clearwater on the morning of Jan. 1. Two family members went early to Knoxville and were at a motel on the morning of Jan. 1 when they received a text that the flight was cancelled. The other four of us were on the way to Knoxville when we were called by our family members and told of the cancellation. I spent 45 minutes on hold arranging for new (replacement) tickets from Lexington KY to St. Pete that afternoon. We finally booked the tickets and headed north to Lexington for a 1.15 pm flight. We pulled into the airport and arrived at the ticket counter only to find that the flight was delayed 4 hours. We spent several more hours killing time until the flight took off at 6pm. We arrived at St. Pete too late to get our rental cars. Both the originating flight and the return were operated by Sun Country which seems to be a much better airline. The only thing that made the travel acceptable at all was Sun Country. I will never fly this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,2,N Niseteo,7th January 2014,We were group of 8 travelling on December 26 flight 221 from Bellingham to Las Vegas. Told that flight was cancelled - Allegiant offered hotel vouchers to passengers who lived 50 miles away. Allegiant didn't have any service personnel at Bellingham airport who could help with re-routing to get to destination only way was over the phone with long wait. Allegiant accepted all passengers who wanted to continue on flight next day. We all lost one day of paid hotel accommodation and one day of paid 2 rental cars. Return was a little less disrupted just delayed for one hour and 20 min. Reason was 'they didn't have crew for airplane'. We all decided that Allegiant is going to be last choice in our travelling due to unreliability.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,,,2,no

Apparently Allegiant has no reps at airports just the contractors who process people onto the planes. We were advised not to leave the airport as the situation might change. Two texts later from Allegiant had the flight delayed another 1.25 hours. The promised food and beverage coupons did not show up in the boarding lounge as promised (we waited and hour). Apparently it takes time to print the vouchers! Trying to contact Allegiant customer service produced a 30 min wait on ""Live Chat"" or 60 min wait on the phone.

Allegiant Air,1,J Horowitz,4th January 2014,Fort Myers FL on Dec 26 flight was delayed going to Knoxville TN and I returned home at 1.30 this morning. This is by far the worst airline I have used. In the past 3 years we have traveled Allegiant over 30 times and each trip it has become a joke. They are never time staffed or polite. I am currently waiting on a flight I received an email this morning telling me that the 2.30pm flight was being delayed until 11.30pm. I have since tried to check for updates online and by calling the customer service line.

Allegiant Air,3,M Hansen,3rd January 2014,My family flew round trip from Rockford IL to Punta Gorda FL over the 2013 holidays. Our trip to Punta Gorda went very well. I am blind and one of the flight attendants came up to me as soon as I got seated with my family and offered me a personal safety briefing which I gladly accepted. The seats on the airplane (a Boeing MD80) weren't that comfortable and did not recline and there was no hot coffee available for purchase. The crew were professional and we got from point A to point B safely. On our return trip we were diverted at the last minute to Moline (2 hours away by car) because of freezing rain in Rockford. According to what passengers were told later we were unable to land in Rockford because there was a plane stopped on the runway and there was not sufficient room for us to land safely. On our arrival at the diversion airport the flight attendant working the forward cabin went through the usual post-flight announcements even going so far as to tell passengers not to smoke until they were outside the terminal to claim our luggage at the baggage claim area and how to book future travel on Allegiant. Upon our arrival at the gate we were informed—that in addition to the weather in Rockford our plane had a mechanical problem. Passengers were sent into the airport and told that further information would be provided to them when it became available. The flight attendant showed no sympathy. The Allegiant representative at Moline was wonderful. There was little information available about when—or even if—the plane would be repaired and sent back to Rockford. As we were leaving the airport the gate agent announced that the plane had been fixed and that anyone wishing to go to Rockford should go back to the boarding area. The real issue for me was the lack of professionalism from the crew on our return flight. I might have been willing to overlook the diversion and mechanical problems if the crew had been sympathetic calm and professional. But everything on the return flight added up to a never-again” experience.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,,,2,no

They said that I would receive a message by 3pm Pacific time for the rescheduled flight but did not receive any news. Finally found out my flight would leave at 7pm on Jan 2 (36 hrs after the original departure time) only to find out it was delayed again. I was then told I could switch my departure city to Des Moines IA so when I called to do that they cancelled that flight as well when I was on the phone with the agent. Never experienced such awful customer service.,,,Economy Class,,,,2,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,Francisco Nix,3rd January 2014,On a flight from Grand Forks North Dakota to Sanford Florida this past December 2013 my flight was canceled. We sat on the tarmac for an hour while they figured out what was wrong and another 30 minutes locating the part and trying it again. Finally they determine they could not fix it. Well the next day they had it fixed. However they determined the plane was too cold for the passengers so we had to wait for them to warm it up. Once they warmed it up they determine the water was frozen in lavatories. So the only guy working had to get several pitchers of hot water to try to unfreeze the sinks but to no avail. Finally he said to use the hand wipes so we boarded and finally took off. I had bought the trip-flex and used it to change/extend my return flight since I was delayed a day. However you can't change it online you have to call in. Well it seems that this cheap airline is cheap in labor and maintenance.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,1,J Schreiner,3rd January 2014,Recently returned from a trip down to Florida originating from Niagara Falls NY over the holidays. Our flight was scheduled to depart from Niagara Falls IAG airport at 11.57 am on Dec 23 2013. Arrived early only to find out that our flight had been delayed an hour. We purchased food at the airport cafe while we waited. Around 12.30 pm we were told that the plane was being re-routed to Ohio due to poor visibility and our flight would be further delayed. We had to wait a further 2 hours before boarding at 5.30 pm due to outstanding paperwork on the plane. We did not receive timely or detailed updates during this 5.5 hour delay. Not knowing when our flight was going to depart passengers including ourselves were forced to purchase food and beverages multiple times from the airport cafe and vending machines. When we finally did take off at 6.15 pm (6 hours later than our scheduled departure) we were offered complimentary snacks and beverages on the flight. I had hoped that our return trip would be redeeming for Allegiant however I was once again disappointed. Our return flight from Punta Gorda (PGD) to Niagara Falls (IAG) on Dec 28 was scheduled for 3.30 pm. Arrived at the airport at 1.30 pm only to be notified by the check-in counter that our flight had been cancelled. Told our flight would be rescheduled but it could be anytime the next day. We did not receive any notification until 12.55 am. Our flight had been rescheduled to 1.44 pm on Dec 29 so once again we repurchased food for the flight and drove another hour from Naples to Punta Gorda. Prior to boarding (at 1.25 pm) we were told by the representative that since the chartered plane had a different seating plan than the regular Allegiant planes passengers can seat themselves anywhere regardless of whether they paid extra and pre-ordered seats or not. In addition upon going to the restroom on the plane I was shocked to find that there was no running water in the washroom and we could not wash our hands.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,1,,3,no

Allegiant Air,,L Mattie,30th December 2013,I flew round trip from Vegas on 23rd and 27th December. Between the two flights I had 15.5 hours of delay. Each time I was notified in advance but both occasions they didn't have a plane and had to fly one in from somewhere else. Allegiant is based in Las Vegas I don't understand why they didn't have back-up planes readily available. The flight that finally took place on the 23rd was on the oldest plane I have ever flown on. It smelt old and musty. The flight on 27th was supposed to take off at 3pm and didn't actually get off the ground until 2.15am. Instead of getting home at 4.30pm I got home at 4.15am. Spending so much time in the airport on those two days I was able to witness their operation. They didn't not get a single flight out at a reasonable time either day I was there. Next time I'll pay the extra few dollars to fly on another airline and get where I want to go. The only good part was my bag was not lost.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,3,no

Plenty of room once I was on the plane for my bag just another way for them to sound cheap but they are not.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Travis Beagle,29th December 2013,"Some staff professional but others quite rude.

Allegiant Air,5,M MacBeth,25th December 2013,Reasonably well-organized. Purchasing online was easy. Received email update when departure time changed. Flight was on time both directions. However employees could be a little more attentive. The gate attendant in Mesa was brusque. I was 'blessed' to sit beside someone with a dog - and that person was also traveling with family who had a very small child located elsewhere on the plane. The dog was whiny - as was the child and the adults were not terribly successful in quieting either. Even though there was considerable disruption in my row no attempt was made by the flight attendants to placate those other passengers who were affected. Sadly with the exception of the safety information and selling food and drinks (oh and walking through with a trash bag) they were rarely seen. Yes I'll likely use them again - but only because of the airports they serve.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,2,,3,yes

Going online plugging in confirmation number all you find is your return trip information with no rescheduled flight information given to your itinerary number. Complete and total lack of professional shown by this airline for the customers on this flight.

Allegiant Air,,J Gallegos,21st December 2013,I have flown this airline to and from college for the past 3 years and I never have had a good or even average experience. The check-in staff are rude and do not try to help. The worst experience was for the holidays this month not only did my flight get cancelled but I was never informed of it. Looking up the flight online said it was on time so I drove the 2 hours to the airport only to find that it had been cancelled. I had a paper for a motel thrown at me by the attendant with no directions or an address. All in all I will never fly Allegiant again.

Allegiant Air,,K Peters,19th December 2013,We were late leaving Appleton by about 45 minutes when a 10 minute delay was announced. The plane smelt like an old locker room. By the time we got into Sanford we hit rush hour traffic and our Disney World tickets that we had already paid for were a waste for that day. On our way back there was a young mother with 2 tiny kids that made it through ticketing security and they shut the door to the jetwalk just before she got there. They never paged her overhead and there was a supervisor manning that gate that was extremely rude and condescending to her. She left in tears. This was on a Monday morning and my understanding was also that there wasn't another flight for her until Thursday. Also I thought the ban on e-readers on take off and landing was no more. We had to turn ours off. I will not fly this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,Barbara Smith,16th December 2013,"Originally the airline pushed our December 9 2013 11.20am departure (from Sanford/Orlando FL to Hagerstown MD) to 5.20pm (they notified us 2 days in advance via email). We were glad that they emailed in advance allowing us time to change plans which benefited us. However with the change to 5.20pm we arrived in horrific weather conditions and Hagerstown airport closed after we had circled for a while. So we were diverted to Youngstown OH. Allegiant paid for overnight stays for all customers aboard at 3 nice local hotels (including limo service to and from and full hot breakfasts the next morning). Hagerstown airport was not well equipped to deal with this ""special"" situation so it took 2 hours to get everything organized but we were very pleased at how Allegiant took care of us. We will definitely be glad to rate our experience as very positive and we will most certainly be return customers in the future.",,,Economy Class,,,3,5,3,1,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,John Maya,11th December 2013,Return flight from Vegas to Austin was delayed 4 times before they finally cancelled it at 9pm. Wasted all day at the airport and now next flight is today at 12.30pm. I won't get back to Austin now until 5 or so tonight so it'll be another day wasted. Got switched 4 times from gate to gate. Boarded a plane got as far as the tarmac then turned us back to gate due to pressure gauge failure. Sat on a hot plane for about 30 min then had to wait around for another hour for them to finally tell us flight was being cancelled. They put us up in an old hotel waited around at lobby for another hour to get a room. Then the room I got had no heat in 30 degree weather was eventually switched to another room at about midnight except this time no hot water. Took a cold shower this morning and am now waiting for 1230 flight back to Austin. Buyer beware. Do not fly Allegiant airline if you have a choice. Worst experience ever.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Chris Schmidgall,10th December 2013,My husband and I have flown Allegiant before without any issues but on Dec 1 flight from Bloomington Il to Orlando/Sanford we had a 5 hour delay with no reason why and they used a a different airline (Falcon Air) . On our return flight Dec 8 again we had a delay of 4 hours with no explanation (also Falcon Air). You cannot tell me that someone did not know why they were delayed. Also $8 food vouchers and $50 vouchers is enough to compensate for long delays and no information. We wasted over 12 hours at the airport that could of been used vacationing. Will be looking into other airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,E Swing,9th December 2013,Dec 2 2013 Flight 2835. Dec 5 2013 Flight 834. I am very disappointed in Allegiant Airlines. They were 7 hrs late on Monday Dec 1. I was scheduled at 5.05 they called the night before and moved it to 7.40 then text and moved to 9.20 then called and moved it back to 7.40. I get to check in at 6 and it's back 9.20.The bright spot they did give us $8 for food. Of course we know the price of food at the airport. The great rate is not worth it. I lost a day of work this week. That is unacceptable.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,Chuck Kloster,7th December 2013,Why does everybody expect something for nothing? We flew Allegiant on November 21 2013 from Cedar Rapids to Las Vegas. Departure was on time as was arrival. Returned on Dec 5 and once again departure was on schedule and we arrived in Cedar Rapids 15 minutes early. Yes I paid for one checked bag and one carry-on. No the seat did not recline - but at least there wasn't a kid in front of me who felt that he had the right to slam his seat into my knees. I really didn't have a problem paying 2 bucks for a Coke either. The aircraft was comfortable and clean and the total fare was reasonable. Oh I almost forgot - as a non-stop flight we didn't have to put up with the hassle and stress of changing planes in Denver or Chicago.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,2,R Smith,7th December 2013,Flew from St. Pete FL to Tri-Cities TN on Nov. 5. The night before I did get an email that said that the flight had been delayed from 7.45am to 3.05pm. I was thankful for that because their were many people that didn't get the message. So about 2-2.30pm they announce a gate and plane change. They had to get a plane from another airline Suncoast. Since this plane didn't have the same seating they changed to open seating. So they boarded handicapped first then priority people then groups with small children then people with assigned seats and then everyone else (seems like Southwest seating). By the time we did all this it was about 4.15pm. They did give us water and a snack pack on the trip. So we get there late and what do you know there is an Allegiant plane already at the gate. We have to wait another 30-40 minutes until that plane leaves until we can get to the gate. There were no weather problems at either city. I overheard the Suncoast crew saying that Allegiant did have any crew available and that's why they had to change planes.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Edith Rappolt,6th December 2013,"I had a flight booked on Allegiant Air for Monday December 2nd that was scheduled to leave just after 10 am and arrive in Clearwater at approximately 12.15. Instead it was after 7pm before we departed and about 8.30pm before we arrived in Clearwater. I was never notified the flight was delayed so spent nearly 12 hours in the airport as our departure time changed several times. The reason we were given had nothing to do with weather or natural disasters just that ""our flight team timed out and must go on rest time and we haven't been able to find crew to replace them""! Really! Now here I am on Thursday December 5th again stranded in the airport with Allegiant Air waiting for a flight that was to depart at 5.05 and now being told it will be between 9-10pm hopefully! Reason this time again not weather ""we just don't have enough planes to cover all the scheduled flights"". ""We have chartered some planes but now that crew has timed out""!",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Connie Tilley,6th December 2013,Terrible. An 8 hour delay on Monday from Greensboro to St Pete now supposed to leave today at 5.05 from St Pete to Greensboro and they just informed us that plane will not leave until 9.40.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,no
Allegiant Air,1,Victoria Frittitta,4th December 2013,I have to say no stars for this airline. So called 'customer service' hung up on me once then when my son called them back they hung up on him too. I signed up for text alerts on my phone but they did not advise me (even after we traveled 3 hours with a rental car for the second leg of our trip to Knoxville airport). After checking in we found out that the flight was cancelled for mechanical reasons for possibly 1-2 days. We ended up renting another car and drove 15 hours reaching home after 4am. What a way to end a vacation! I have to admit they did eventually refund the money because I refused the $100 vouchers they offered. Did not need the vouchers because now I intend to pay full price for a major air carrier. Just so you know because they are not a major carrier they do not make other arrangements for you and if you find a flight you can get on you re paying for it again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,9,Dave Mengel,4th December 2013,Saw all the bad reviews and don't understand why. I have flown Allegiant many times with no delays other than weather and the staff were great. Can't beat it for the cost. Would recommend to anyone. How else can you get to Florida in 1hour 45 minutes from Ohio for 75 dollars.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,K Doub,3rd December 2013,I had a flight on 11/11/2013 from Oakland to Phoenix. The flight was delayed 2 hours before they finally cancelled it. They didn't give us any idea if there would be a flight the next day so I had to book my own flight on Southwest so I could get to Arizona at a cost of $350. My return flight on 11/25 was delayed 4 hours! Today my fianceé was supposed to fly from Oakland to Phoenix and he just received notification that his flight is delayed 2 hours! You really can't depend on this airline. Flights may be cheap but you might have to pay more on another airline in order to get to where you want to go.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,S Burns,3rd December 2013,Sitting at Sanford FL airport as I write this. Arrived early for the flight back to Springfield MO. Flight was cancelled due to missing crew member last night. No notification on website. Aggravation is not worth it. Now as I sit here waiting to get within 3 hours of home on another flight and wasting an entire day I regret ever trying them on a friend's recommendation. No real recourse no food vouchers. Other choice was wait 24 hours and try again. Hotels food and transportation all at our expense. Needless to say I will never use them again and do my best to ensure anyone that will listen doesn't either. The only good thing I can say is they are direct flights (when they actually fly) and the seats weren't too bad. We were offered $100 off our next flights as if I will ever use them again. Tonight at 5.34 when the plane lands will be the last time I ever consider Allegiant Air.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,1,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,1,S Paulus,3rd December 2013,11/27 flight 888 from PIE to ABE. 12/1 flight 803 from Harrisburgh to PIE. They may have low rates but nothing is included and I mean nothing. Carry on check bag water on the plane cookies pretzels peanuts not included. You must pay for everything. There is no inflight entertainment. The seats do not even recline. The planes are old and antiquated the staff are rude. No one is in a hurry for anything. They give you no information no courtesy whatsoever. They change the rules every step of the way. Every person we talked to had a different story and nothing matched. All they did was lie to us. Everything was delayed and there was no compensation to the passangers for the inconvience that was given to them. First our time was changed with no notificAtion then we were told we had to wait 4 hours because the pilot and crew needed time to rest. By the time you pay for baggage a beverage and every other thing you have paid way more than the other airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,1,R Raybon,2nd December 2013,"I have used Allegiant Air during my 4 years while attending school out of state. Yes the cheap flights home when I had breaks were great but I was always delayed. I might have been on one single flight where everything was on time and they didn't push back the time due to ""operational issues"". There were also several times where I had to walk to my car in the airport parking lot in pitch black late at night because my flight was pushed back so much. Me being a young girl this was very unsettling. Allegiant feels that offering free complimentary drinks when the flight is delayed will make everything better well they are wrong. Also when you run into an issue there no settling a canceled flight at the airport you have to sit on the phone for over 30 minutes waiting for the next available travel agent. Honestly I don't think the issues that come along with booking a flight on their airline is worth the cheap flight.",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,2,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,William Bert,2nd December 2013,Our flight from Oakland CA to Bellingham WA was delayed 5 hours - no explanations or apology were offered. The ground crew were too inexperienced and timid to criticize. They didn't seem to be in the loop any more than we hapless passengers were. There were no weather problems at either end of the flight. An earlier leg of our trip (Bellingham to Vegas) was delayed for 2.5 hours - again no explanation or apology but it was raining heavily on arrival in Vegas so we assume that was the reason. I sent an email to their customer service and got a very quick personalized but unapologetic response. I've been a life-long traveller and have travelled on many no- frills airlines so I know what to expect in terms of crowded seating and lack of freebies. However as countless others have attested Allegiant Airline is the worst because of their shoddy customer service both during and after travel. This truly is the worst airline in North America.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,D Durbhakula,29th November 2013,Austin to Las Vegas Nov 28th Flight number 453. They say low cost airline but they rip you off. Myself and wife were traveling to Las Vegas. The flight was empty and system generates random seats we both were not travelling together. To travel together we have to pay 35 USD. When I called the customer care to adjust the seats since the flight was empty I was given a very rude reply. The price we paid for our tickets we could buy with other airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,,no
Allegiant Air,1,W Bromagen,28th November 2013,Took a non-stop from Fort Lauderdale to Lexington hoping to avoid the mad scramble in Atlanta. Big mistake. This airline left late due to engine issues (had to get a replacement aircraft) then when we arrived the ramp wouldn't work. It took 45 minutes for them to figure out they needed to open the rear stairs and allow us off. No discussion of perhaps just taxiing to a different gate. After replacing another hour yes hour awaiting bags. My advice skip the non-stop and stick with Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,S Pierce,27th November 2013,Granted it's inexpensive but be ready to be delayed. Have flown it often but probably 95% of the time flights are delayed. And not just a few minutes or a few hours. More like anywhere from 5-9 hours. Totally unacceptable. Have kept trying them due to direct flights and low costs but our time is too valuable to spend so many hours sitting in airports.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,Michael Koenig,25th November 2013,Tried using this airline twice. The first time they cancelled the round-trip flight the night before departure. They didn't offer any alternative transportation. Just apologized and said I was on my own to figure it out. I had to scramble to get other transportation. I asked the customer service rep if Allegiant would give me any discount or such on a future flight. I was told I would have to email them complain and ask someone else. That was 8 weeks ago and still no response. The second time I tried to use Allegiant they cancelled the flight 12 days in advance. This time without explanation. How did they know they had to cancel that far in advance? In short the price is attractive but what good is that if you can't fly. I'll never use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,Edmonds Mary,20th November 2013,Absolutely prefer this airline. Love the price direct flight and the smaller airports. Flew Sioux Falls to Tampa 11/16/13 and back 11/19/13. Will consider them first before any other airline.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,9,D Smith,19th November 2013,Springfield Missouri to Punta Gorda November 14-17 2013. Flight out was delayed slightly but most time made on the way to Punta Gorda. No problems on return. $150 pp R/T including bag fee. Staff was great service was good. If you know the rules and play their game on ticketing luggage and check-in you can save money. With older second hand aircraft you are bound to have some delays but for the price you can not do better. Many trips on Allegiant and only one serious delay.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,5,Jo Hampton,19th November 2013,I was extremely dissatisfied with the fact that I had to pay for a seat. I chose a seat that I liked and preferred to sit in paid the fee and expected a good flight with a window seat close to the front of the aircraft. When I arrived to board I was told that we were to board a different plane and that the seat that I had paid for no longer mattered and I had to sit wherever I could. Granted I will be reimbursed the money for the seat but I paid for something I did not get and was not forewarned until boarding. I got stuck in a middle seat and was uncomfortable the entire flight. This is not good business. If a customer pays for something they expect it.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,3,,4,no
Allegiant Air,,C Atherfold,18th November 2013,Was supposed to fly out of Plattsburg NY direct to Clearwater FL Nov 1/13 . The plane got into the air and had instrument problems within 10 minutes of take off and had to return to Plattsburg airport. A very stressful experience. The plane had to circle for about 45 minutes to get rid of fuel. Fortunately we had a safe landing and all precautions were taken with fire trucks and ambulance available if needed. Upon arrival back at the airport we were offered Pizza as there would be no replacement plane arriving for 5 hours coming from Tampa. A full refund was offered if you decided not to take the replacement flight and a phone number was given out to call. We opted not to fly. The problem started with confirming our refund. No 1-800 number a long distance call with a wait of 30 minutes only to be told that a form had to be filled out online first . Very poor customer service. In the end a refund and a free voucher for future travel that would have to be redeemed by calling that same number.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,R Candow,14th November 2013,Bellingham to Vegas got to airport on time but found out our plane was delayed cause of a flat tire. 6.5 hours later we left as they had to fly a tire from Las Vegas on the next flight. They gave us water pop and a $8 voucher for food. They said they would give us a $100 voucher for our next trip on our account. I phoned them and no 800 number so you have to pay for the call. They go threw a 5 minutes of jargon and then they tell you you will be another 20 minutes. Did not wait.

Allegiant Air,1,A Arrants,12th November 2013,I had a voucher from Allegiant that I had from January 2013 and had to use by Jan 2015 which I did the end of October 2013. They had already charged me $80.00 for voucher issue which they deducted. Very hard to use website in booking a flight. I chose my seats which I paid for did not get the ones I signed up for on my departure flight. Then I made a typo scheduling my return on 12/22(was supposed to come back on 11/3. Not their fault on that. When I had to change it they charged me for seats again adding $342.00 in fees for my wife and myself. The seats don't recline nor or they comfortable. Very cheap. Will hitch hike before ever using them.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,2,Bryan Eckerley,10th November 2013,3 hour delay to destination and 4 hour delay coming back.

Allegiant Air,1,K McCandless,10th November 2013,When flying Allegiant Air - check your VISA statements. Our family booked for an upcoming trip to Vegas and should have been charged $3021 however we just received our statement and we were charged 4 x for same trip. Then the whole frustrating deal trying to talk to a human - first you have to email them then they will give you a phone number then you have to phone and wait time is between 30 - 90 minutes (in our case 90 minutes of Long Distance from Canada) only to be told they don't see the error on their end so send them the visa statement as proof. Which I did and asked for confirmation that they received fax as well as confirmation when it is corrected. No customer service No apologies.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Diana Butler,5th November 2013,Flight 773 Fort Wayne to Sanford Oct 31. Flight 772 Sanford to Fort Wayne Nov 3 2013. We were charged $100 ($50 both ways) for a carry on that we hadn't prepaid for. If we had prepaid it would have been $26 total. It's the same bag why would it cost so much more if you add it at the desk? All beverages and snacks are for purchase only including water.

Allegiant Air,8,J Cook,4th November 2013,Was very apprehensive about flying Allegiant after reading all the bad reviews however the return flight from Bangor to Orlando was absolutely fine.

We were advised another ""rescue"" plane was on its way and would arrive at 6.50pm we start getting text messages at about 5.30pm that now that flight was cancelled as well due to mechanical reasons. There were over 100 people on this flight and Allegiant says they have hotel vouchers for only about 55 people not to mention the food vouchers they decided $8.00 at LAX was enough - you can barely get a good cup of coffee for that price in this airport.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,I Pitzak,31st October 2013,"Travel with Allegiant is a nightmare! According to their own personnel their planes are old and break down often. My trip from Provo UT to Oakland CA was delayed by 6.5 hours. The return trip one month later was an odyssey: it took 11 hours and 3 different planes before we could make the 1.5 hour trip. The first plane fully loaded with 200 passenger was not able to even get to the main runway before breaking down and was towed back. The second plane sent to ""rescue"" came 5 hours later but was grounded due to mechanical problems. We had to wait more hours for another ""rescue plane"".

We were to call in 2hrs to find out if we were to leave the next day but again no information. On top of all that we were all double booked coming back our bags were all labelled wrong.

Allegiant Air,,Rossner Jean Pierre,29th October 2013,Got what we paid for. Yes the airfare is cheap however when you starting adding up the extras it will amount to the same price. We live in Montreal Canada not far from the NY state border flew from Plattsburg to Fort Lauderdale. We will never fly Allegiant again. Customer service is horrible both on the phone and onboard. Staff are unknowledgeable. I will add that at the time you could park free at the airport now the charges are too high nevertheless they charge for luggage and other fees and that brings the total to the same as for someone leaving from Montreal to Fort Lauderdale Florida.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,4,M Lui,28th October 2013,This is the most disorganized and unprofessional airline I've travelled with. My husband and I flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas. I spoke to a woman on the phone to find out how the seat selection works. She was very short with me I called a second time spoke to a different person who told me I'd be better off checking in at the airport as opposed to online if I don't want to pay and want to select 2 seats together because online it's computer generated but at the airport a real person will select seats for you. Upon arrival at the airport I was told that wasn't true regardless how you do it it's all computer generated. Our flight ended up getting cancelled due to fog and the plane landed at a different airport. It took them hours to give us this information even though they knew the flight had landed elsewhere. Finally we were told the flight would be the next day. No assistance was offered to help us with the cost of an overnight in a hotel. When a mob formed to complain they reluctantly offered names of several hotels that would provide a distress rate. On the flight the seats are pretty cramped and do not recline at all. Absolutely nothing was offered in the way of food beverages or reading material not even water. Initially you would think Allegiant is a much cheaper alternative but they charge you for everything. If you bring a carry on it's $13 in advance or $50 at the airport each way. For a checked bag it's $20 in advance or $50 at the airport each way.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,1,,3,no

They will sell your ticket right out from under you. My daughter checked in 45 mins before her flight out of Mesa AZ. She was told she was too late but watched in tears as others boarded the flight she was supposed to be on! The representative stated the next flight is next Thursday!

Allegiant Air,3,Samuel Stephens,22nd October 2013,I travel from the Huntington and Charleston WV area to Orlando or St Petersburg Florida at least once a month and have done so for 5 years now. Allegiant has charged a one way price as cheap as $19.99 each way and as high as $249.99 each way. Prices are very weird. I understand their schedules and schedule problems. I don't understand their prices. Allegiant is convenient for my travel plans but in 5 years they have made so many changes with booking baggage and especially seating. They never offer any kind of relief for any of their mistakes. Today I received an e-mail advertising a one way special to St Petersburg for $44.00 for dates 12-9 through 12-23. I immediately opened the website and tried to book at this price only to find out after a 45 minute wait on the customer complaint phone line that those prices sold out completely but there were plenty of seats available for $92. Gate personnel in Huntington have been very rude and even yell at passengers. Customer complaints and assistance by phone are put on hold up to an hour. Gate rules and booking rules are not enforced once on the plane. Such as overhead usage and seating. I will continue to use Allegiant but only if I can catch a good price. It is much more convenient consistent and comfortable to drive an extra 45 minutes to Columbus and book with Airtran.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,1,Don Reideler,15th October 2013,Two hour delay to ride on a plane with mechanical problems treated rudely not offered even a bottle of water for being delayed. Other airlines we have flown on have given us vouchers for food when we were inconvenienced. I witnessed an Allegiant employee laugh at a customer that had waited over an hour for her luggage. We stood in line with the other passengers on our flight for 15 minutes while three agents leaned on the counter and did nothing only to find out we were standing in a line that was for re-ticketing for a cancelled flight. The re-ticketing agent was telling passengers that they were in the wrong line one at a time as they requested their boarding passes. Our agent was very gruff and acted as though he was conducting some kind of military exercise.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,5,R Baird,15th October 2013,We were booked on Flight 541 from Monterey to Las Vegas on Sunday 10/6. After the plane was loaded a passenger had to be removed by security and the flight was then cancelled. This cancellation was not the airline's fault. But the flight the next day was scheduled for 5.35 pm and it was delayed until 7.30 pm. Then once we were all on the plane ready to go the auxiliary power unit would not turn on and there was another delay until they could get the engines started. We finally arrived in Las Vegas at 9 pm. Monday night. There were no problems with our return flight but after this experience and reading the other reviews I don't think we will take Allegiant again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no

Allegiant Air,7,C Ray,9th October 2013,Just flew from St Pete to South Bend and back over the past weekend. We purchased and checked in online with no problems. They're a nice airline with friendly staff and clean fairly roomy planes. Our only issue was the punctuality problem they seem to have with everyone. Our flights were delayed both times by 20-25 minutes. Not deal killers but still annoying. Seems like they would be more concerned about maintaining their schedule but they don't apologize and everyone acts as if that's standard procedure. Feel free to leave the A/C on while we're waiting to depart or deplane. It gets stifling real quick.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,L Mahoney,6th October 2013,I will never fly Allegiant again. We were told that we had to arrive 2 hours before departure at the gate this morning at Oakland Airport. We were there on time at 7.30am for a flight to Provo Utah. A half an hour before departure they tell us they forgot to notify the 1st Officer that he was flying so we waited 1.5 hours for him to arrive. Once he got there we were notified the plane had been grounded and we had to wait for another to come from Las Vegas. Flight finally took off 6 hours late. The pilot was very apologetic and said we could have a free drink on the plane but when I asked for a bottle of water they said I could only have a cup!

Allegiant Air,9,Carter Shelton,2nd October 2013,When flying from Tri-Cities Tenn to Florida they are the only direct-flight game in town. We have used them for several years with minimal delays. They were particularly good at responding to the loss of several aircraft a few days ago. If money were no object I suppose we all would be using a chartered Lear but for most of us money is a factor and Allegiant provides reasonable service at an unbelievably low price.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,5,yes

Allegiant Air,1,Margaret M Lee,24th September 2013,"When Allegiant Air began flying from Allentown PA to destinations in Florida they were wonderful to fly with. Their staff was courteous and their flights were very reasonably priced. I told everyone I knew how wonderful my experiences were with them. How things have changed! They are now one of the rudest group of people I've ever encountered in a service based industry. During my past few trips from Allentown to Clearwater I've had one bad experience after another. Instead of trying to help they've continually stated ""We are now an a la carte airline"". I'm sure that they don't care but they have lost another customer.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,9,J Barker,22nd September 2013,For the money that we paid it was an excellent flight. I flew from Las Vegas to Kalispell MT - Yes they charge you for any added things such as carryon luggage seat assignments onboard drinks etc but if you are interested in a low fare and getting from point A to point B - I don't think they can be beaten. Our flights were on time the crews were cordial and the check in experience was comparable with other major airlines. Allegiant is a discount airline so you cannot compare their services with a Delta or America. They provide basic transportation at a very reasonable price. The downside to them is that unlike the major airlines they do not have a large number of extra airplanes sitting around so should you encounter a mechanical problem the plane will have to be fixed before you can fly they cant fly in an extra aircraft. I think for the money paid they provide an excellent value in airline travel - you simply must realize what they do and that is basic air transportation.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,2,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,Floyd R Utz,18th September 2013,My wife and I were flying from Stockton CA to Las Vegas on June 30 after attending a wedding. The flight we were supposed to catch was finally cancelled after keeping everyone waiting for the entire day. We were supposed to leave at 2.20pm but the rescheduled flight didn't leave until 7.45 the next evening on July 1. No less than 3 other scheduled flight left for Vegas before I would have been allowed to board a plane. I refused to be at their mercy and caught a flight from Oakland that put me in Vegas around 7.00am the next morning 13 hours before the Allegiant flight finally left CA.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,Catharine Janssen,18th September 2013,A couple of weeks ago I flew for $66.00 to Florida and $66.00 return. I have a vacation home south of Tampa so I don't need to take luggage. I take my purse and walk on and off the plane with no hassles. Yes I have to pay 2.00 for water pop or a snack but compared to paying 500.00 return flying from Ottawa I just can't justify spending the other 350.00 difference and Air Canada doesn't provide meals anymore. Yes I have to work around the Allegiant flight times and pay for my snacks and yes I have less flexibility but I am saving a lot of money! I find the staff courteous friendly helpful and professional. I don't need an inflight movie it is only a 3 hour trip. I applaud this airline for providing good service at great prices and direct flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Tilford Marshall,16th September 2013,I have flown many different airlines in my 76 years but I must say the charter with Allegiant to College Station Texas this past Saturday September 14 2013 was one of the most abysmal experiences I have experienced. Firstly the cabin crew were rude and professed ignorance of information regarding the charter flight. The beverage service offered by the airline would have done well in a comedy routine no coffee/hot beverages yet the bottled water was served at room temperature (no ice offered) and in this case tepid. The plane itself was dirty and odorous and the lack of ensuring the aircraft was serviced and ready to go upon departure to Birmingham from Houston Bush was out of a Keystone Kops routine. The supposed delay caused by mechanical issues was explained in 3 different stories from the same representative concerning a door that was an emergency egress that could only be opened from the outside heaven help us had we had an emergency that required using that (rear) door if it could only be opened/closed from the outside. A trip of 12 hours inclusive of a 2 hour ride to the airport passenger airport procedures and attending a 4 hour football game ended as a twenty six hour expedition. Never again will I be a passenger of Allegiant Air and I strongly discourage others to use Allegiant.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,D Little,16th September 2013,"We used this airline for a charter flight round trip from Birmingham Al to College Station Texas and then back to Birmingham out of Houston. Never again. The flight attendants were so concerned with socializing with passengers who were buying alcohol that some of us barely got or regular drinks. On way back the flight was delayed for 4 hours due to ""mechanical issues"" in College Station and then the flight crew had to have their FFA mandated rest period. They told us at the gate that when the crew got there the plane would be fuelled up and ready to go. When we boarded the plane it was hot and the AC was not on because of the engines not being on. The pilot then came on and told we would have to wait to leave until the plane was refuelled so we were lied to at the gate. Overall horrible experience.",,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,H Walter,12th September 2013,We had our flight cancelled from Bellingham to Maui this August. After standing in line for almost 2 hours we found out the flight was cancelled only when other passengers were getting calls on their cells from the airline. The counter staff looked like teenagers and were no help at all. Finally after several hours an Allegiant rep showed up and we were put up for the night at local hotel only to arrive the next morning to have our flight delayed again two more times. Very poor service. Even airline employees told us this is a recurring problem and not to fly with them at all. I think after reading all these reviews I will take their advice and throw away the flight credits they gave us for another time.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Kelly Stout,11th September 2013,"My son flew from PHX to Oak 9/6/13. The plane was delayed 1 hour for weather and 2 more hours waiting for a replacement crew member. Return flight was set for 9/9/13 at 2.30pm here it is 8.40pm and they have just taken off from Oakland. There were ""mechanical issues"" is what they were told. There were a limited number of food vouchers available and warm bottle of water at the gate. When I called the airline I was told they do not refer to another airline and that ""pizza and drinks were given out at the gate"". This was not what I was told by the agent in OAK when I spoke to her at 4 pm. Told they would however give me a $50 voucher for another flight! Never again.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,J Bigelow,10th September 2013,We have flown Allegiant since they came to our area and have never had a problem We flew out September 1st to Las Vegas. Ticket agent was great fast and friendly plane took off on time and we even landed in Las Vegas a few minutes early. Return trip was the same ticket agent was friendly and funny. Flight attendants on both flights were friendly. Plane took off on time and we landed on time. Ok so the seats don't recline not a problem we just stood up once and a while to stretch our legs. Food no problem the wife packed some snacks for the flight out and the return trip. All in all we have had great trips with Allegiant and we will continue to fly with them. We love the direct flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,2,J Paul Remmy,9th September 2013,"You get what you pay for! We have flown with them 6 times and noticed that there is a 50-50 chance that you might make your destination on time (or on the same day). Do not depend on them to get you anyplace on a tight schedule. We always allow 1 day between connections. Departure passengers often sit on the plane for hour(s) - sweating/freezing - while the status of the flight will be reported as ""in route"". Very often the Flight Staff are a blessing and they have a lot of humor about how bad the service is (In Flight Entertainment!). If Allegiant promises you a refund/voucher don't hold your breath. SWA will be about the same price once you factor in the extra $$ on bags seat assignments old Coke and bagged peanuts.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,4,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,B Leany,8th September 2013,"Attempted to fly my sister out from Oakland to Reno during the first week of their new route. She was supposed to leave at 5pm and arrive at 5.55pm. The plane has now been delayed 3 times and now projects a 4 hour delay which is the amount of time it took me to drive the same distance last weekend. When I inquired with the airline about the delay they replied ""we have no information about the reason for the delay"". When I expressed my own concern about a delay that was so long given the length of the route they did not seem concerned and instead gave me a canned answer about variability in reasons a flight is delayed. I wish I had read the reviews on here before purchasing a ticket. Apparently a flight schedule for Allegiant is kind of like throwing a penny in a wishing well.",,,Economy Class,,,,2,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,T Hughes,8th September 2013,Flew Allegiant for the first time from Bellingham to Maui. Flights were fantastic (left on time and arrive in Maui 30 minutes early). We are a family of 4 from British Columbia Canada and by flying Allegiant we were able to save over $3000 in air fare. The flight wasn't full so you could spread out between the seats or sleep on 3 if you wish. We brought our own food and purchased bottle water at the airport. Yes the planes are basic and don't have TV's etc. but if you're prepared (bring your own portable DVD players cards books etc) the flight was good (actually spent time talking to our kids rather than having their noses stuck to their phones). Would definitely fly Allegiant again already planning our next trip!,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,Laura Keith,3rd September 2013,Niagara Fall to Clearwater. Waited close to 12 hours on the trip down only to have it cancelled late that night. We were not allowed to leave the airport let alone go outside for some fresh air. Staff at the airport were very accommodating and apologetic however the person who was calling the shots on how to handle the issues missed the ball entirely. Finally got out the next morning with another 2 hour delay. Coming home there was another mechanical issue with our plane and we were delayed another 4 hours. An awful experience.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,4,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,2,Linda Jones,2nd September 2013,Flew from Niagara Fall to Clearwater. It was supposed to be a 3 day get away. Waited close to 12 hours on the trip down only to have it cancelled late that night there were no other planes available. The staff at the airport were very accommodating and apologetic however the person who was calling the shots on how to handle the issues missed the ball entirely. We finally got out the next morning. There were quite a few Allegiant planes at the terminal the next morning not sure where they were the day before. Coming home there was another mechanical issue with our plane and we were delayed another 2 hours. We've flown many times and have never experienced any lengthy delays like this one. Our whole trip was book thru Allegiant waiting on rebates hope that comes on time!,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,1,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Gorgenia Datayan,29th August 2013,Got what we paid for. Yes the airfare is cheap however when you starting adding up the extras it will amount to the same price. We flew from Bellingham WA to Honolulu it was about a 6 hr flight. The seats do not lean back. Therefore for the whole 6 hours you are sitting straight up. We will never fly Allegiant Air again. Customer service is horrible both on the phone and onboard. They are unknowledgeable. I hope Allegiant is reading these reviews and take notice.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,K Veenstra,26th August 2013,"I paid for carry on luggage since I was only on a 3 day trip to PIE out of LEX. I requested wheelchair assistance which they provided without problems. The kids who brought me to and from the gate at both airports were great. Boarding the plane in LEX the flight attendant looked at me as I got out of the wheelchair and looked at my carry-on. She asked if I could lift it and I said no I would need help. She practically ripped it from my hands and said ""well I can't do it for you"" and said it would be gate checked. I let that go but on the return flight again I was asked if I needed help and again I said yes. She threw it in the overhead and said ""next time check it!"". I will gladly pay more for another airline to avoid flying with them again.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Baylee Welch,23rd August 2013,"I was on a flight from Montana to Las Vegas. Plane arrived 2 hours late was not given a reason or an apology. Once everyone boarded the and were just about to take off (or so we thought) the plane had ""technical difficulties"" and we were forced to sit on the parked plane for another hour and a half! The flight attendants were rude and did nothing to make us feel comfortable as we sat there with no explanation as to what was even going on or when we'd be leaving. I then missed my connecting flight because we were five hours late getting to the airport and was stranded in the Las Vegas airport by myself forced to spend $540 on a new ticket to my final destination to Chicago. They charge you for every bag the service is unbelievably poor. They do not care about their customers.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,4,P Williams,22nd August 2013,Sanford to South Bend and back. Flight home was Sunday Aug 18th 2013. I do fly this airline but things keep changing and flights getting cancelled. My complaint is that 2 travelers flying together getting tickets at the same time and paying with 1 credit card are put in two different rows. This is 2013 when you can do anything with technology. When I addressed this onboard I was spoken to rudely. My theory is I was being punished for not paying for my seat and other passengers agreed.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,K Hollingsworth,22nd August 2013,We travelled for 3 years on Allegiant from various locations in Montana and Sioux Falls as flights were a great deal and they were direct flights to LA. Last year the charges for carry on luggage were introduced and that was just about a deal breaker. Then when we had to exit from the back of the plane on the LAX landing strip after two hours in the plane due to another mechanical problem after having waited approx. 3 hours on our trip down the week earlier due to mechanical problems that was the last straw. We no longer felt safe on this airline the numerous mechanical delays you read on this website site attest to this. It was a good airline once. It was a good value once. No more.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,1,Kathryn Daley,13th August 2013,A week ago our daughter and granddaughter travelled on a direct flight from LAX to Billings MT. They were to arrive at 8.05pm. They arrived at 1.50am. A 6 hour delay. They were given $8 in food vouchers. Since we are an hour from the airport we didn't get to bed until 3.30am. Shockingly enough just 7 days later on their return flight yesterday they were again delayed. This time 7 hours! They were supposed to leave at 8.05pm but were delayed until 2.50am. They didn't arrive home until 7.45am. This time they got $8 food vouchers and $50 trip vouchers which are useless as we will never use this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,C Loehr,13th August 2013,Their rates aren't that cheap after totalling all of the add-ons and my time is much more valuable! Arrived at the gate in Vegas exactly 1 hour before we were to leave. They did not start boarding until 20 minutes before plane was to take off it took almost 45 minutes for them to get the plane loaded. After waiting in line to take off we were almost an hour late leaving Las Vegas. When we landed in Grand Junction another Allegiant jet was in our space. We sat on the tarmac again. They had two people to work both planes! Luggage was another hour. A 57 minute flight took us 5.5 hours! We could have driven from Grand Junction to Las Vegas in the time it took us for this direct fight.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Dave Merrell,6th August 2013,Four hour flight delay leaving Provo UT for Oakland CA which meant that I would be missing the meeting I was going to. Flew to Oakland and on the return trip I had an 8 hour wait. Both times it was mechanical problems. They kept announcing vouchers they would be giving out. Everyone thought they would be for future tickets but instead they gave $6 food vouchers.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,Judi James,6th August 2013,Arrived at Peoria Il. airport 2 hours early on July 22. Instead of leaving at 5.20pm because of problems we didn't leave until 10.20pm. Arrived in Las Vegas at 1.40am arrived at our hotel at 4.15am. We could have almost saved a night's lodging. Returning from Las Vegas to Peoria 2 hrs. late - they were short a plane! 40 Minutes on the tarmac doing paperwork. All in all it was not a bargain experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,C Grant,5th August 2013,I took my first and last flight on Allegiant had to go to Montana for business. Flight to Montana was over 3 hours late. Flight leaving Montana (different city) was over 8 hours late sat on plane for 2 hours with the same excuses as outbound. Replacement plane had to be flown in from AZ. but it wouldn't arrive for 2-3 hours. 30 mins later the plane coming from AZ is no longer going to come. The Allegiant reps at the ticket counter were not able to change a passengers ticket to a different flight had to call the customer service number. Was on hold for 1.5 hours trying to talk to customer service. Ended up missing my Southwest connection in Vegas.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Joseph Portmann,5th August 2013,Flew from Boise Idaho to Las Vegas on August 1 2013 - flight #469 delayed 3 hours. Return flight #468 from Las Vegas on August 4 was delayed 4 hrs and 40 minutes. Sat on the tarmac for about 1.25 hours of the LAS to BOI delay due to a mechanical issue. No complimentary drinks (alcohol) nor complimentary vouchers for future flights were offered for either of these delays. I am a MVP Gold with Alaska and Preferred/Premier with Delta. Any time this happens with either of these airlines there is always something offered due to the inconvenience. First and last time for me flying Allegiant Air.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,2,,3,no
Allegiant Air,7,A Tindell,5th August 2013,Pasco to Las Vegas 3x to Mesa 2x and Los Angeles 2x. You don't fly Allegiant if you expect comfortable seats warm service or even being on time. It's a relatively inexpensive ride that's all. Bring your own drinks and food. Get to the airport a couple hours before the flight. Don't show up with overweight bags. Expect flight delays. Expect skeletal staff that's worked to the bone doing multiple tasks. Don't fly Allegiant if it's a really significant trip like attending a wedding or going to Hawaii. Don't get same-day-as-flight show tickets in Vegas. If you play defence like that and expect nothing more than bare minimum no frills travel then Allegiant isn't a bad way to fly. The longest delay I ever had was a 3 hour delay leaving Pasco for Vegas. It killed that evening there but we hadn't booked and shows that evening either. Just flew to Los Angeles this past weekend. Short acceptable delay going down. Return flight an hour delay because they initially didn't have a flight crew. That was a new one. But they flew faster and we arrived only 45 min late which is essentially on-time for Allegiant.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,3,yes
Allegiant Air,3,L Turner,4th August 2013,I have flown Allegiant about 8 times in the last 18 months. It is a great deal when everything goes according to plan. I think in the last few months there have been more and more problems. And to have your flight cancelled and rescheduled for the next day after waiting in an airport for 5-7 hours is extremely poor customer service. Staff seems to do the best they can under the circumstances. Lately I have not been getting very good rates either by the time everything is added in. I'm back to flying Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,,3,no
Allegiant Air,7,C Hjelmeland,1st August 2013,Great for the price. Even with the extra charges for baggage stored in overhead and paying the small fee for a selected seat to ensure we all sat together the total cost per person was still half compared to using a major airline. We flew from Mesa AZ to Rochester MN round trip and there was only about a 30 minute delay at departure and about a 45 minute delay for the return flight. You can also save on baggage fees by paying a head on line any time before check-in. For only a 2.5-3 hour flight the tight seating was bearable. I would hope for a longer flight that they use a larger airplane with more room for comfort.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,8,R Bryant,31st July 2013,I have taken 3 flights from Des Moines IA to Las Vegas the last 3 years. Overall the price was good flights on time and staff friendly. Even with the added costs of luggage seat purchase etc the airline is still cheaper than others. The older MD 83 aircraft are a cause for concern and I am aware from friends that they have higher than average delay rate. I will still fly them because of price and non-stop service. All airlines have problems.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,D Messier,30th July 2013,My granddaughter was supposed to take her first solo trip today. I had her to the airport well in advance. The board said that her flight was to be delayed 1.5 hrs. When she had made it through security I left her. I got home at 2.00 in the afternoon thinking she would be boarding around 3.00. The day progressed and she finally boarded thinking her flight would be leaving at 5.00. Well they eventually took everyone off the plane then put them back on then took them off again. I picked her up around 7.00. She had been told that the plane would leave at 8am and that information could be found online to make the changes. We can't find anything online so we hold and we hold and we hold. This is one of the worst experiences ever.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,S Samra,30th July 2013,Stranded at Las Vegas McCarran International airport for 5 hours. Told that our original flight with 200+ passengers was delayed due to aircraft issues to 12.30pm and was scheduled for 9am. At 12.30pm told that it was delayed again until further notice. All we were offered were $8 meal vouchers and soda cans/water. Now we are told that an empty plane is coming for us from Phoenix. Seems like this airline is always having issues. It is possoble that our flight will be rescheduled until tomorrow morning. It is currently 2pm and we have no notice as to when/if we will be departing.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,2,,1,no
Allegiant Air,8,T Fletcher,29th July 2013,I have flown with Allegiant a few times over the last couple of years. They fly to the city closest to my daughter (St. Pete FL to Plattsburgh NY). Generally the best value and location for me and good service. All airlines have mechanical problems from time to time but I do worry about the age of the planes. They had plane trouble today (July 29) again and bussed passengers from Albany GA to St. Pete FL. I am planning a trip for November and contemplating my options based on today's flight problems.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,K Welch,23rd July 2013,I will never fly with Allegiant again. We booked a flight from Provo UT to Oakland and back. A simple 1.5 hrs flight. Not so! Both flights had a 4 hour delay. The only compensation given was a complementary drink. Planes are to old and need to be replaced. The seats do not recline and carry on bags are $25. You can take your chances but I never will again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,K Panzner,21st July 2013,My mother flew myself husband and our two minor kids from Ft.Wayne Ind to Tampa/ST.Pete. When we boarded the flight attendant told us to throw out the drinks we came on plane with even though their website says you can bring food and drinks on board. Staff very rude. On way home the plane was in horrible conditions. We were unable to sit with our minor kids but some fellow travelers did switch seats with myself and my 7 yr old daughter. Never again will I fly them.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,10,J Riddle,17th July 2013,My wife flew Allentown-Sanford one way on July 7 and all went smoothly. No hassle printing out online boarding pass with aisle seat assigned for free no security hassles at under-utilized ABE airport flight smooth was actually due in 10 minutes early but in fact arrived on time. She was travelling with a personal item only so no extra fees to her rock bottom one way fare. I agree with prior reviewers that their fees do add up quickly so plan accordingly. Also keep in mind Allegiant flies from small airports which generally mean higher fares so at least you get the non stop service with them. Also bear in mind if you suffer a delay which is common with all airlines these days this could have been time wasted with 1-2 hours at a hub airport. As in most customer service reviews people quickly point out the bad without reporting the good. My advise is give them a try and judge for yourself.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,3,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,,M Hirsch,16th July 2013,Waiting at the airport more than 5 hours and still here. The management keeps telling us stories. I am flying from GSP to FLL.

Allegiant Air,5,Bob Johnson,15th July 2013,Booked 3 passengers at the same time from Mesa to Duluth. Each seat was in a different row. Seriously? Another way to get you to pay money. Flight left at 6.45 am - we were told that once we were at altitude they would be coming around with the snack cart where all items were for sale however no coffee or tea but they had a full assortment of alcoholic beverages. Really? I can't get coffee but I can buy a beer? No thanks! No delays on the flight but waited for an hour for our bags at baggage claim. Spend the extra money and fly another airline.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,1,3,,3,no
Allegiant Air,4,S Vivian,10th July 2013,I get that this is a bare bones service but when an airline resorts to intentionally separating people because they didn't pay to choose a seat that's going too far. Not only that on a 2/3 full aircraft (both ways) they wouldn't let us move. This was on a flight between Bellingham and Honolulu in January 2013 and instead of impressing us with their value they were mean spirited in an attempt to extort a few more bucks. We won't fly Allegiant again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,,3,no
Allegiant Air,,G Rudell,9th July 2013,Ft Lauderdale to Greenville. Seems to be a consistent theme on this site. 4.25 scheduled departure - actual departure - midnight. Reason - 'mechanical' issues. There were 40+ kids on our flight heading to camp and still had a 2 hour drive to NC after we landed.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,3,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,8,James Hoar,9th July 2013,Nov 2012 we flew out of Bellingham family of 5 2 adults 3 under 12. We saved almost $1000 flying Allegiant the parking was where we saved as well as Allegiant flies into smaller airports. Check in was fine and we paid for assigned seating. Well worth it as we were 5 and we had the first row. The seats were fine no complaints. Flight left on time. The cabin crew were nice and attentive. No high pressure sales. My kids loved the snack packs they sold on board and I didn't mind paying for them they were not that expensive. The plane was clean but they are older so there has to be some wear and tear. Flight times were exactly as mentioned. We paid for 5 carry-ons. Coming back we were delayed 4 hours at LAX and had to move to another gate. Yet when we boarded the flight was good. So with the small fees and delays I being not wealthy will continue to fly Allegiant.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Allegiant Air,7,J Aumann,9th July 2013,Flights both ways from Vegas to RFD and back went well. Flight out was on time. Plane was clean and seats were comfortable. Staff very friendly and courteous. Experienced good communication from staff and pilots re: gate change need for full runway slightly warmer cabin until engines full on and longer taxiing and delay about an hour on return flight. Airline does charge for both carryon and checked bags and food/beverages but this is mentioned on their website. Smaller plane so important carry on baggage meets their specifications which is listed on their website. I had no problems re: carryon checking in and printing online boarding pass. Overall a good experience with them. Would fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Allegiant Air,,Marsha Parry,4th July 2013,First time and last time flying Allegiant. Flew from South Bend to St. Pete. First flight delayed 3 hrs. We had just begun take offf when we stopped abruptly and were told there was a gauge problem. We had to deplane while we waited for the maintenance crew to drive back to the airport! On the flight home we were delayed an hour again due to an air-conditioning problem. Sat on a very warm plane and finally left after the captain said we could fly with one air conditioner working. No free drinks were offered for all these inconveniences which were significant! The low price of fares is also not worth it because you have to pay for everything from checked bags to overhead bags and seat assignment.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,2,1,,1,no
Allegiant Air,,Bert Hansen,3rd July 2013,Plane was 3 hours late. After arriving in LV we had to sit on the tarmac for 3/4 hour until a gate opened up. They are trying to run an airline to maximize someone's profit at the expense of customer service.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,,,2,no
Allegiant Air,,J Carlson,3rd July 2013,"We signed up for text alerts for the 6/28 flight from Punta Gorda FL to Springfield IL. As expected we received alerts that the flight was delayed from 3.20 pm to 6.35 pm. Instead of sitting at the airport for a few hours waiting I chose to arrive 1.5 hours before the flight was scheduled to leave at 5.10 pm. When I arrived I learned that TSA closes at 5.00. There were no Allegiant employees at the ticket counter and when we attempted to contact ""customer service"" we waited for over 1 hour only to be disconnected and then called back to be hung up on. Told that we still had to be at the airport 2 hours ahead of the original scheduled flight. Why would they offer text alerts if they still expect you to be at the airport?",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,1,no

We understand that but then we were put back on the plane and it was thunder and lightning and we were delayed another 1.5 hrs onboard arriving 3.5 hours late. On our return flight 5 days later arrived to be told of a 2 hour delay finally they pushed up the time for boarding after 1.5 hours and we were in the air close to our destination an announcement was made that we could not land in St Pete Fl and would have to go to Tampa and they would shuttle us to St Pete. There was no organization and I and 3 others waited forever for a wheelchair and then had no one to push them. We finally got going about an hour later and couldn't even find any shuttle buses so we had to rent car in Tampa.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,1,,3,no

Went to cancel and request a credit for future travel and was told that on a $500 flight, the cancellation fee would be $200 per ticket or $400 for this flight! 75% of the cost! Most absurd thing I ever heard. Southwest does not do this. Will never give American Airlines another chance. Also purchased, what I thought was their trip cancellation insurance at the time of booking on their site only to find out this is a separate company and basically this coverage only covers specific situations.

I explained to her three times I did not wanted to check those items and retrieve them at the baggage claim. She printed out and put the papers on the busters without me agreeing to it. The other person working at the gate realized what was going on and stepped in and helped the situation. She printed out the correct tags and we were able to check the two busters at the gate and retrieve them as we walked out of the airplane.

American Airlines,1,Matthew O’Donohue,13th October 2017,"Verified Review | Columbus to Chicago. The worst experience I’ve had flying with an airline. The tickets are much more expensive than their competitors (Southwest, etc) and there is less room for seating and less room for carry-ons to be stowed above. The overhead storage space is so limited that I had to check a carry-on I brought, which may cause fragile items to be damaged. When asked about why I would have to check this, the female attendant spoke with an extremely annoyed and sarcastic tone telling me “well that’s too bad, you can take a seat and book another flight”. This is awful practice, and is a mystery to me why a person like this is getting paid to represent a company. I will never fly with American Airlines again, and I suggest anyone considering flying with them abandon that idea.

Airline ticket is a contract allowing 2 carry on bags, which AA are now claiming isn't the case on this aircraft though the fine print neglects to mention that.

American Airlines,2,P Marston,11th October 2017,"Verified Review | Cancun to Knoxville. American Airlines is one of the worst airlines out there. They overbook and the planes are very much out of date. Our plane in August to St. Thomas looked straight out of 1970 with no in flight entertainment. Still even has ashtrays. How is that for a 4 hour flight? We paid way too much for that type of service! Unfortunately where we live and want to fly to, we have 2 choices which are AA and Delta. From now on, we will try and take Delta. Our last 3 experiences with AA have been lackluster. We were bumped from our return flight we made 7 months in advance with little compensation. They put us up at a hotel and gave us each $20 for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. Breakfast alone was $23 per person plus tax for a buffet so you can imagine how much lunch and dinner was. The hotel AA put us in said AA overbooks and bumps people often! Not to mention the extra money we had to pay for pet sitters and time missed from work coming back over 24 hours late. They made very little apologies. After emailing back and forth, I finally got $200 flight vouchers. But it didn’t come easy.

I sit here at gate D25, waiting to board a flight I shouldn’t be on, more frustrated than I’ve ever been with an airline. I’ve had one bad experience after another with American Airlines. I arrive to gate T9 around 5am and immediately go to the check in desk because I’m flying Basic Economy for the first time so I want the gate agents to know that I’m here and would like a seat number for the flight. One rudely responds, “We’ll call your name when we’re ready for that.” I sit down patiently waiting for my name. Finally my name is called, and she asks me if my small duffel bag is the only bag I have? I respond that yes it is. Another agent chimes in that it looks like it it is too big and that I will have to pay for it. I respond that it should fit under my seat, so I put it in the demonstration bin and of course it fits. They tell me they just wanted to see my bags and that I can sit back down and wait for the next instruction. When it comes time for boarding group 9 to board, I wait for my name to be called. (now apparently there are two individuals with my last name, and the other individual is flying standby. But I don’t find this out until later.) they ask the group to walk with them down the runway and wait for a seat number. I ask the agent when I can board since I paid for a ticket, she asks the other agent about me who checks her list and says that “You’re not on my list!” They give up all seats on the flight and I have now missed my flight. We get back to the desk at which point I’ve never had two grown women be so disrespectful to me. They both blamed me for not getting on the flight. Saying the flight had two Individuals with my last name but not once did they call a first name. I now know that neither Individual with my last name made the flight.

Once we finally got off the plane I had 10 minutes to get to my next flight so the stewardess directed me to an AA desk to get another flight. The desk of 3 American Airlines worker had no one at their gate or desk so the stewardess left me their for the 3 girls to help me. The 3 workers never looked up from their desk, and when I finally got them to acknowledge me they said they couldn’t help me because they were busy preparing for an international flight that left in 5 hours! I asked them to at least see if my flight had done last call. They refused saying “we don’t have all the time in the world to help people that aren’t on this flight”. Again, that flight didn’t leave for 5 hours and there were 3 workers! I finally made it down to my gate and spoke with customer assistance. The 3 workers there were all on their cell phones, which they didn’t put down when I arrived for help. I explain the situation and also told them I was shocked by the lack of customer service I received at the other desk. 2 of the workers giggles and rolled their eyes while on their cell phones.

I have you on a new flight, have a nice day”. I’m happy the gentleman was more “welcoming” than the other 5 customer service workers but I can honestly say this is the worst airline customer service I have experienced from any airline company.

This caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connection in Dallas. We ran across the Dallas airport and made it in time to see our plane and have another passenger who made it to the gate after us to be let on board. American told us that the system would not let us in but they let the other passenger on board because he had others in his party on board. We also had two in our party that made it on the plane 1 minute before us but they paid no attention to that detail for us. I have over 50,000 miles with American and don't think I can ever fly with them again after being treated this way.

American Airlines,1,T Carben,16th September 2017,"Verified Review | Seattle to Quito via Dallas. For about a year, we planned a trip to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu, and bought round trip airline tickets on American Airlines. The night before our flight (flight departing morning of 8/5/17), we printed boarding passes. At approximately 10PM we received a non-urgent email from American stating: please call to rebook your flight. No other info given. We almost overlooked the email because of the lack of urgency and the fact that we already had our boarding passes. When we called we were informed our entire trip to Equador was cancelled due to ground conditions. I called both airports we would be landing at and they reported no delays or ground conditions. American Airlines would not tell us what the ground conditions were. The night they cancelled, American Airlines only offered to move us to a flight on American leaving 48 hours later which would not get us to our destination for 4 days. (Our original flight would get us there in just over 24 hours.) They would not put us on a flight with another airline, which were available. They did not apologize and treated us like we were wasting there time. We were told we would not be given any compensation for the loss of 4 days of our trip. I called other airlines myself, in the middle of the night, and booked us on Delta (for flights that would get us to our destination on time,) but had to pay $4500 out of pocket. Delta got us to our destination on time and with no ground condition delays. We landed at the same time our original flight was scheduled to land. Upon return from our trip, we tried to contact customer relations at American to get a refund. There was no phone number, so we wrote an email and waited for a call. A day later, a representative notified us we would be getting no compensation for our losses. She gave a cursory ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" She gave us no further support and would not transfer us to a superior. She actually rose her voice with us when we asked to speak to someone else and said she had the authority to make these decisions. There are no phone numbers for customer service, refunds, or managers. Approximately 1 month after our cancelled flight, we finally received a refund of $1680 for the cost of the flight that was cancelled, but we were not compensated for the $4500 we lost. We felt that each person we talked to was unhelpful and even rude at times. We understand that flights can get cancelled but expect to be helped onto another flight in a timely manner or compensated for our losses. At the very least we should have an explanation of why our trip was cancelled. American did none of these and we will never fly with them again",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Quito via Dallas,August 2017,,,,,1,1,no

A woman then made a smart comment about using the qiosk to check in our bags. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the qiosks are meant for busy times.

I explained to her that the other airlines were still operating and asked if they could take care of my ticket with another airline, that was denied. At one point the supervisor got on the line and said to me ""I am not sure why you are wasting your time talking to us when you could be booking a ticket with another airline."" If all flights were cancelled I would have understood, but only mine was. Which really frustrated me, if you cannot fly into that specific airport, reroute the flight and fly into one that you can.

Even if there hadn't been a hurricane, this would have been bad news because they changed the flight from a Sunday to a Monday.

I am not sure on what basis they have stopped the 3 travelers out of all economy travelers. All 3 were Indians. They were not ready to arrange any other flight. The only flight which is available in AA is next day morning. They said they will arrange accommodation. But they have given a single room for all 3 of us. When i checked with manager to give separate rooms, he said it will be provided in the hotel. But when we reached there it was only 1 single double room and of us had to sleep on the floor.

American Airlines,1,D Thomas,8th September 2017,"Verified Review | Avoid American Airlines at all cost. They could not care less about their customers. I spent 17 hours at different airports all do to with American Airlines problems. Starting my flights in Salisbury, MD. Supposed to have a connection in Charlotte, then on to Fort Lauderdale. The first flight being overbooked. Thinking I was helping out the airline, I accepted a 300 dollar voucher and rebooked on a flight that should have gotten me into Fort Lauderdale earlier than my original flight. Now the fun starts, arriving at the first airport at 5am and finally getting to my destination 17 hours later. The first flight of the day was overbooked. The 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems causing me to miss my connection because of the delayed flight. Since I missed my connection American Airlines tried to find another flight for me, the next flight they offered was almost 10 hours hanging out in the Philadelphia airport before taking off. Then they found a different flight leaving about 3 hours later with another connection in Charlotte. When we arrived in Charlotte, the American Airlines gate area was a total mad house. People standing everywhere up against each other and people sitting on the floor, because of American Airlines problems. It felt like there was no air conditioning, because of all the people in a small area. They were all talking on the microphones at the same time, mentioning delays and offering 900 dollars or more for giving up flights. Now the connecting flight in Charlotte then was delayed several times. Because of all the problems with American Airlines, I missed a lunch and dinner. Also a friend had to rent a 2nd car, because I was the one with the car rental for the trip. Once I got home a few days later I contacted American Airlines and explained the situation, and to let them know I was not pleased. Of course I get a company generated form letter, not even mentioning my complaint, just stating policies. This company could care less about their customers and how they treat them. Being such a large company, they should be more concerned about customer relations.

I guess I have not flown American in a long time. Most airlines put you on the next available flight when you miss a flight. American they put you on stand by for each leg of your flight. Or charge you $200 to reconfirm plus a $200 up charge. I was at SFO for 16 hours I had to pay $75 to grab another flight even though I paid $950 for 2 one-way flights just 24 hours prior. American customer service team members were the worst, they must train them to have a blank face and not care at all. The counter reps in SFO all could care less about helping at all.

American Airlines,1,S Harker,4th September 2017,"Verified Review | Atlanta to Philadelphia. They told us they had a problem in the system, so we would have to wait a little - which I didn't have a problem with. Then they went on and on and kept on delaying the expected departure time. And after 2 whole hours of sitting on the plane, they told us we would have to go outside in the boarding area and wait. At this point I was a little annoyed, but not mad. After that, they made us wait 3 more hours outside in the boarding area, with little to no help from the staff on when we were going to leave, before they told us the whole flight had been cancelled. I was going to miss a whole day of seminars that I had to attend. Then I was like its okay, mistakes happen, and then rebooked the flight for the next morning at 6AM since they had no more available flights on that day. I got back home at around 2, so I had been there for about 8 hours. The next day I was on my way to the airport when I got a text message that my 6AM flight had been cancelled too. At this point I was furious. It was not even a weather related issue, it was because of American Airline's lack of preperation ahead of a flight, in which they always seem to have problems with their system. I had to call their customer service an try to rebook, since I had to get to Philly as soon as I could. The staff on the phone were horrible, first they said there were no more flights availble on that day to philly, (In which there were because I could literally see that there were available flights - I was looking at it on my phone when I was talking to them). Then I asked them if they could switch me to another airline, in which they said that it was not possible. I hung up the call out of frustration, and called them back a few minutes later, this time someone else picked up. I asked him the same question I asked the other guy, that if they could switch me to another airline. This time, the answer was different. He said he could switch me over to united. I was shocked, because the other guy told me they could not do that. The united flight was later in that day, so by then the program I was going to attend in Philly would be over, so I decided to ask for a refund. I had to scream at the guy to let me get a refund because he was refusing to give it to me for ""privacy"" purposes, which didn't make sense at all. Even after all that I went through, I could not understand how someone could not give someone their money back. After about an hour of yelling and convincing, he finally gave me a refund.

Was feeling a little thirsty before take off and asked one of the cabin crew members for water. It was the most unpleasant exchange I have had with an airline staff. The conversation went: Me: excuse me, can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff (male): what's that? He asked the question in a very rude manner and looked visibly annoyed that I was asking him something. I would have expected something along the lines of: ""I'm sorry mam, I did not hear you."" In any case, I repeated my question. Me: Can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff: Well we're about to take off so I can't. I did not catch the rest of his answer because as he started responding he simply turned around and continued talking as if he wasn't talking to me - all this in a very rude and angry tone. I thought to myself I'm only asking for a glass of water and if indeed it is not possible now, the correct and polite answer would have been: ""I'm sorry mam, but unfortunately we are about to take off so it is not possible right now. We'll bring you a glass after take off."" For someone who travels quite a lot with major airlines and have platinum level with some airline mileage programmes, I was quite shocked because this is really the lowest in terms of the quality of in-flight personnel.

Once, my flight was delayed by 5 hours. Typically it is a 45min. flight from Boston to Philadelphia. And the bus takes about 7 hours. But when I fly with American Airlines, the travel time is almost similar to a bus journey.

Rude and care nothing about their customers. The best part is when we got to customer service they had three people working. When a line started up 2 of those 3 people just left. Leaving one person to deal with everything. Then when you ask to speak to a manager. They make you wait an hour until a flight attendant shows you were they are one gate over.

For the second delay, the passengers had actually completely boarded, and then we were told to disembark. When we finally got on the plane - three hours late, the pilot gave a very brief (and disingenuous) apology and then said, ""Well, it is what it is.""

American Airlines,1,H Kanahiv,19th August 2017,"Verified Review | I am extremely disappointed with the service I received at American Airlines I travel quite a lot with American Airlines accruing miles through their AAdvantage program. For the first time I decided to finally use my miles towards a car rental. I went ahead and applied 28,800 miles for a 6 day rental in Mallorca (paid in full). When I came to pick up the car at the PMI airport, the teller did not recognize the voucher and prompted me to provide my credit card. At first I thought it was only for incidentals but at the end of my trip, they charged my card in full ($274). I only realized this after I arrived back home. I contacted American Airlines and informed them of the issue. They acknowledged that Avis (the rental car company) made a mistake and that they would facilitate a refund of my miles. After a few days passing, I did not hear back from American Airlines nor did I see the miles credit back on my AAdvantage account. I followed-up with American Airlines. A representative responded to my inquiry and informed me that there is nothing they can do. I repeatedly inquired to escalate this issue to the supervisor. He claimed he was a supervisor and said there was nothing they can do. In short, I spent 28,800 and $274 for a mini-car for 6 days. Is this fair? I think not.

She was escorted to gate E24 and was told her flight to BWI would be departing from E24. She notified me via text that she was at gate E24. The AA flight status information on the app, website, and airport monitor noted flight AA2018 to BWI was departing from gate C10. She was left at the wrong gate.

AA reps then rushed my daughter to the correct gate. AA was paid an unaccompanied minor fee, however my daughter would have missed the flight had it not been for parental intervention to get her to the correct gate. I sent a letter to the VP of AA requesting a refund of unaccompanied minor fee. I received a response denying the refund stating ""she was still properly escorted for the entirety of her travel while on board and in the airports."" They also let me know they were logging this into their 'sophisticated database"" so leaders can review it. I addition, to make the reservation one has to call AA. The AA rep on the 1-800 stated they would waive the fee. However, when I checked her in the AA rep at the airport stated there would be an additional charge. I explained that the 1-800 folks waived the fee; the airport agent charged me regardless and even pulled out the AA policies to show me. There was definitely a communications/knowledge gap in process. I should have been told upfront or a note placed on the file that it was waived.

First we have a 4 hour delay in Charleston, because apparently the air conditioning on the plane wasn't working. Then after 2 hours trying to fix it they finally assign another plane to come pick us up in Charleston from Charlotte, NC. This delay causes us to miss our connecting flight and bumps our departure to tomorrow morning (or so we thought). Upon arrival in Charlotte, we find out that our flight to Des Moines was delayed too allowing us to make the flight however it was too late, they sold our seats and we couldn't get on the flight despite being on that flight to begin with. This experience caused me to miss a critical business meeting. I've had nothing but poor experiences with American and it's frustrating to yet again be stuck in a connecting city when it turns out I was on time for the flight anyhow. Thanks for selling the seat that was mine and bumping me to the following day. Come to find out while mingling with a frequent traveler departing Charleston, this is a regular occurrence and this plane frequently has mechanical delays. Take the time to service your equipment.

We were to be given ""snacks"" plural but got only one snack serving at the start of the flight and nothing during the rest of the time. We had no brewed coffee available. The flight attendants' uniforms looked as though they had slept in when we boarded the plane. This was the most class-less First Class. The air quality was also poor. There was a strange smell when we got on, and it did not dissipate. You could choose to close air vents or endure cold air blasting down on your head.

American Airlines,1,S Hatten,11th August 2017,"Verified Review | Los Angeles to Shanghai PVG. I just encountered the absolute worst check-in and security I have ever experienced. We were at the American Airlines terminal at LAX. They insisted we checked in using machines, none of which worked for us. When we went to a desk the lady behind the encounter was rude and accused us of using the machines incorrectly. We were given seats not next to each other for our 13.5 hour flight. When we asked if we could sit next to each other the woman told us it didn't matter we'd just have to ask people to swap with us or we would have to pay a minimum of $150 per person to change seats to be together. We went to complain and got sent to the priority check in desk. When we explained the situation, the person behind this desk said aggressively that the seats must all be sold out except the extra leg room seats. When I said the other person hadn't said these seats were extra leg room, just that we had to pay to sit together, she told me I must have heard her wrong or misunderstood her. The priority desk person then threw our passports and boarding passes on the counter and said aggressively ""you're all set"", when I asked ""what do you mean"" she rose her voice and said ""I put you guys together!"" and gave a shooing motion towards us with her hand. No apologies, no explanations. We the continued to the American Airlines security area, put our things in boxes and queued up to go through. A security person, again aggressively shouted at people saying ""you have to stay with your boxes"", so my boyfriend and I stayed in the queue to go through next to our boxes about a foot away. The same person then came very close to my face and said ""Miss is that your box?"" To which I responded ""yes"". He then said condescendingly ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" I didn't understand the question because in every other airport you put your box in the row and staff make sure it goes through the machine for you. So I looked at him confused at which point he aggressively pointed at the box and me and shouted ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" At which point I felt really intimidated and said ""I am?"" Then he said ""exactly. Then get over there."" I felt humiliated. So I got on the queue and walked in to the body scanner when called, stood on the yellow feet on the floor then the next security person again with horrible attitude said ""did you got through pre-security?"" I looked back saw there was nothing else behind me but the area I had just been shouted at in and said ""yes."" He then said sarcastically ""you look like you're wearing sandals"". Clearly I was. So I said ""yes"". He then said in an accusatory, rude voice ""you were supposed to take them off and put them through the x-ray scanner"" and gave me a shooing motion so I returned to the x-ray scanner, put my shoes in a box and got back in the queue.

After boarding we were kept waiting on the group for around 1h50 mins with very little explanation of why. I was sat at the rear of the aircraft and as there is no closed off area for staff they were pretty much just sat around chatting loudly (which is fine, but on most aircraft they have a closed off area and can do it without everyone having to listen). This aircraft had no seat back TVs so we had nothing to do. After take off we were given a very poor dinner, although there was a good selection of drinks. The experience so far was generally poor, but mildly acceptable considering it's a budget airline. However the last 2 hours of the flight were awful. Suddenly the smoke alarms began to sound and the staff very casually checked the aircraft for signs of danger (this was only looking in bathrooms and touching walls for signs of heat) for about 10 minutes. The alarms sounded for the remainder of the flight with no announcement or instructions to reassure passengers.

American Airlines,1,Jordan Barr,8th August 2017,"Verified Review | Me and my family managed to grab a bargain with American Airlines on our most recent vacation from Glasgow to Orlando via Philadelphia. The price was more than 70% cheaper than any other airline operating the route, however if I knew the misery we would have to endure then I definitely wouldn't have flown with AA. The first problem arose at check in (GLA-PHL) where we were allocated new seats from the ones we had previously purchased resulting in my family being split up throughout the aircraft. We complained and was given new seats nearby each other but still not the ones we had paid £200 for previously, which American Airlines are still refusing to issue a refund. Next when we arrived at the gate we were informed that the flight was delayed but that it wouldn't be long and they were going to commence boarding - not long turned into sitting on the aircraft for almost 2 hours. The aircraft was old, in need of refurbishing, extremely cramped and didn't have personal inflight entertainment which American Airlines didn't tell us while booking. The aircraft did have an overhead screen which played one movie during the 7hrs 45min flight to Philadelphia, however me, and many other people sitting around us thought it was unsuitable for children to view. The staff were rude, never came across people with such bad manners, talked inappropriately about passengers onboard the aircraft (which we have complained about) and couldn't be bothered doing their job but instead stand at the back of the aircraft talking. The food was poor quality, even for airplane food, and was thrown down in front of us. The aircraft landed just over 2 hours late making it tight for our connection to Orlando. Once on the connecting flight we were told that our bags had missed the connection and would be sent on the next flight out, not the best news for the start of you're holiday. We had a mad dash to the flight, just making it by minutes to spare, and once we sat down were told that the flight was delayed due to technical problems resulting in another 2 hour delay. The staff were slightly friendlier on the connection to Orlando and we eventually landed about 5 hours late (thunderstorms near Orlando delayed us). We got off the aircraft rather quickly and proceeded to baggage information for American Airlines which told us that our bags wouldn't be arriving until the next afternoon, we were offered several thousand air miles as compensation which we rejected as we had already decided we will never touch American Airlines again.

American Airlines,1,P Dawson,3rd August 2017,"Verified Review | It gets a 1 because zero wasn't an option. Our flight originated in Rapid City, SD connecting through Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX and then on to Newark, NJ. We checked four bags/items ($75 b/c the stroller was free) at the urging of the gate attendant at check-in because they advised the flight would be full and there would be little room in the overhead compartments. Upon arriving in Newark, we picked up two bags and the stroller but the other piece of luggage was nowhere to be found. The surly woman in the baggage claim area of American Airlines (AA) said that the bag was put on the wrong flight but that it would arrive later in the evening and be delivered within 24 hours. I then took the day off work ... but the bag never arrived. Several phone calls later, what we know is that they can't find our bag and that they really aren't particularly concerned about it. Almost every representative that we've spoken with in the baggage handling customer service department has been less helpful than the one before. They cannot locate the bag and they're ""not sure what else to tell us at this point"" (that's a quote). Meanwhile, I'm out an expensive Rimowa bag and several thousand dollars in clothing and other items. Some of them with sentimental value and which can never be replaced. Any effort at replacing our items will be a tedious and time consuming process and I'm sure will be laden with red tape and bureaucratic obstacles. And they won't even begin that process for 5 days. Even though they admit that they can't locate the bag and it's coming up on 48 hours here shortly. American Airlines is a joke, they lose your luggage and basically laugh at you when you seek assistance. Two days later and they have no idea where our checked bag is now? This has to be the worst and least helpful customer service. The poorly trained customer service reps at AA are flippant, unhelpful, and totally unsympathetic to one's plight.

My initial flight was going to be over three hours late on departure due to a mechanical problem with the aircraft. I was able to book another flight out of Nashville. However on this flight, I was forced to check my carry-on bag because the overhead storage areas were full. After boarding this aircraft I noticed many items in the overhead storage that the flight crew should have required to be placed under the seats; things like shopping bags and purses. When I arrived at DFW for my connection I noted an earlier flight to my final destination that would save me 3 hours stuck in the airport. I proceeded to that gate and attempted to go standby. I was told that I was not eligible for that flight because I must travel with my checked bag. That's right, the bag I was forced to check against my will.

American Airlines,8,Eric Williams,28th July 2017,"Verified Review | Being able to fly First Class on a transcontinental route (New York to San Diego) is certainly a treat that I looked forward to. I decided to treat myself to the Admirals Club at JFK which to me was one of the highlights of the journey. Great healthy snacks, fresh guacamole and well made cocktails. The aircraft cabin was standard with leather seats, ample space and well stocked personal Samsung tablets. Now, I believe First Class service should be special including the check-in, what happened to the First Class Check in? It's just ""Priority""! The food was quite tasty albeit the meals were different from what the web-site listed in the pre-order. Here's the issue: the FA's were nothing but robotic and functioning. Fake smiles with minimal service. One drink service, expedited food presentation and that was it! I had to get up to get a simple glass of water. More time was spent in the galley complaining to each other about the company, which was easy to over hear, rather then taking caring of the premium paying passengers, First Class FA's should represent the high standard of the Airline.

American Airlines,1,F Lewis,27th July 2017,"Verified Review | I've always been big on traveling but since mid 2013 I have been taking around 8-20 flights a year, domestic and international, mostly for business purposes. Out of all the airlines I have taken (and I fly to some remote places in the world) American Airlines have managed to be the most consistent with their lack of customer care and disorganization and just a huge shame to what you would expect of one of the biggest airlines coming out of the US. Canceling and delaying is something that happens so often that I have become shocked when their flights go as planned, they offer no compensation of course for those delays and time and energy consuming horrible experiences that everyone hates. American Airlines offer no canceling/bumping a flight like 90% of the time, just zero effort to even try and show just a little bit of courtesy toward the customer in general.",,Business,Economy Class,Oakland to Charlotte via Phoenix,July 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,J Dawson,26th July 2017,"Verified Review | Greenville to Las Vegas return via DFW. My biggest complaint is when I was dropped off by a tour company at Las Vegas (after a 14 days trip) for my return trip home 6+ hours before the flight boarded American refused to check my bags. They said their policy was not to accept baggage until four hours before a flight. Effectively I was being asked to sit in the main departure lobby for 3.5 hours to check luggage. This was unacceptable. After I complained to a self-check attendant she finally agreed to issue boarding passes and said we could gate check one piece of luggage each complimentary. I had been unable to check in electronically due to the tour and spotty internet access. We carried four pieces of luggage, one carry-on each and one piece each we intended to check, to Gate D which is a really long hike. We did this and were accommodated but had to sit with the luggage all evening and take it with us when we went to eat. None of this made sense. Why would American risk making a customer angry and forego $50 ($25 each checked bag x 2) in revenue by refusing to check bags on arrival and forcing gate check? We were tired, hungry, facing a red-eye flight and just wanted to be shed of the baggage. Now let's backtrack to our departure from Greenville-Spartanburg. The flight crew did not show up on time. The captain and first flight attendant showed up for the flight at 7:50 for an 8:05 flight. The other attendant/s and co-captain showed up at 8 sharp. Needless to say we left late. Our connection through DFW was not pleasant. When our flight landed we sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes waiting for a gate. We were told we would taxi to three different gates before the plane actually moved to the original one. We barely made our connection with time for a restroom break. When we departed Las Vegas McCarran to return home the rest rooms at Gate D used by American were filthy. A janitorial staff member was present but did not appear to be doing much. Many urinals in the men's room were cordoned off and out of service. The final leg from Charlotte to Greenville-Spartanburg was on a very old CRJ500 that was so old the upholstery on the head rests was peeling off.

American Airlines,2,D Tanner,18th July 2017,Verified Review | Eight flights in last ten days with American. All OK basic average. Then arrived in San Diego missing one very important bag. American staff at the baggage handling area were neither good or bad and they advised me the bag would arrive next morning at 10:30. American Airlines employ a contractor or perhaps it's two contractors to handle late baggage delivery. My experience of this is that information available on whereabouts of your bag/s is very hard to obtain. The information on the delivery contractor/s website is wrong and not updated. Call handling by American Airlines is utterly appalling and amateurish. Call handling agents do not have required information easily to hand and that indicates American Airlines have a garbage infrastructure. After several phone calls one AA call handler kindly let me know the name of the delivery contractor and I was able to finally find out where my bag was and coordinate delivery directly with the contractor.

On our return again ignored while standing in priority check in while watching coach class customers jump ahead. Again food was a disgrace. This time the stewardess did say the white wine was not yet cold. And gave us the option of warm or waiting a while for it to chill. While waiting to board in DFW we ask if there would be a meal served. Trying to decide if we needed to purchase and carry on something for lunch. To our surprise neither of the 2 AA employees knew and had no idea how to find out. I guess my biggest problem is that first class prices should be supported with first class service and food. Our expectations are based on Delta's 1st class service. Pre flight video wasted no time bragging about being the largest airline with 6700 planes.

My latest experience not only included a delay, a cancellation, and then a flight change to one full day later, it also included a 3 hour cluster-you-know-what of uncertainty as to where our baggage was. The ticket tracing system was completely usesless and when I attempted to speak to one of their robotic customer service reps, I was told that there was nothing that could be done and that my bags would be available the next day in Chicago. (We were trapped in Charlotte for the night). The issue is that at the time of flight change to make up for the cancellation, we were guaranteed by an AA rep that our baggage would be released upon arrival in Charollette. When trying to explain this to the baggage service rep, I was told I was wrong, and that nobody could go get the bag for over 5 hours.

Soon after takeoff a packet of salted pretzel was given out to the passengers but no drinks leaving my mouth totally dry. Dinner was served soon after with complimentary wine and beer. I chose a pasta dish. The small tray was overloaded with smallish portions from all the food groups - salad, bread, entree, dessert. A hot snack was provided before landing. A large selection of films on the personal IFE but the free headphone provided was so poor in quality that I did not watch or listen to anything as the sound was inaudible over the roar of the engines. Advice: bring your own headphones. The seat was not comfortable at all. The padding and cushioning was rather thin. Worse was the tapping you felt on your back whenever the passenger behind pressed buttons on her IFE to select items for viewing - so thin was the cushioning.

In a recent round trip from Augusta GA to Albuquerque NM; the return was routed from Albuquerque to Phoenix to Chicago to Charlotte to Augusta. The lay-over in CLT was scheduled as 56 minutes. The flight in Chicago did not board until 25 minutes after scheduled. The pilot taxied to a runway, waited 10 minutes and announced windspeed was too high to take off, waited another 15 minutes, then taxied to another runway where he announced the wind speed was fine, we were 5th in line for take off. Arrived in CLT and deboarded at 10:12 PM at terminal B16, connecting flight doors close at E24, 10:20 PM. Needless to say, missed flight. American Airline customer service unapologetically offered a hotel and a 9:30 AM flight the next day as only option. Problem - had appointment that I could not miss at 9;30 AM in Augusta. I pushed it - wanted a rental, AA agent got a bit nasty. No rentals available, took car service back (probably cheaper than a 1 way rental in the end). Still arguing with AA - they claim total liability is $90 - the land mile % of total trip that was unused. They blame wind, weather, airport flight controllers and ""me"". I have been an engineer and project manager for almost 20 years, part of the measurement of my job performance is my ability to meet schedule commitments. Why is it that AA believes meeting schedule commitments is optional?",,Business,Economy Class,Augusta to Albuquerque via Charlotte,May 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

I'm trying to remain kind and sweet, but this is the third flight with American Airlines in the span of 3 days that has been delayed, resulting in an overnight stay, and arriving a day later than planned to my destination.

American Airlines,1,A Newton,4th July 2017,Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Phoenix to Chicago. I was shocked upon getting to my seat. There was two partially wet napkins scattered on the seat with tons of crumbs and flakes. The women who was already seated said hers was like that as well and she pointed it out to stewardess and she said she was not concerned about it at all and just threw the napkins on my seat and said the person could just clean it up. What grossed me out the most was I never knew if the wet stuff was from the napkin or was on the seat from the previous passenger. You never know what it could be. I was shocked the stewardess was rude to the other passenger and seemed bothered she had to go get napkins.

American Airlines,1,E Tanden,3rd July 2017,"Verified Review | Cleveland to Minneapolis via Chicago. I have never had such a disorganized, rude, and downright horrible customer service experience. Our first flight was delayed because of one single passenger's passport not going through. A flight full of about 60-70 people delayed 45 minutes for one individual - which should have been figured out by removing her from the flight, as there were many people (at least 25) whom had connecting flights they had to get to, including us. We had a connecting flight in Chicago that was leaving 30 minutes after we landed, prior to the delay time. We were instructed to call the delay hotline to find flights for our party of 8 from Chicago to Minneapolis, in case we did not make it in time to catch our connection. We arrived with about 10 minutes to spare because of a delay in the mechanics with said connecting flight. We got to the gate to assure we were going to make it and it turns out the hotline screwed up 3 of our seats and booked us for a flight leaving 5 hours later than our original take off time that we sprinted through O'Hare airport to make. While I understand screw ups, the attitudes of the ladies at the gate was absolutely unacceptable. Not once did we receive an apology, nor did they seem willing to help, even though we were originally very calm and cooperative. They acted as if it was our fault and even made a comment about my manners, while they continued to treat us poorly. They were well aware of the situation and knew our flight was arriving with little time to make it to the gate and knew the number of seats that were needed. It was in no way our fault, as we did as we were instructed each step of the way. I will never be flying American Airlines again and hope I never have to deal with another one of the employees I encountered in this entire experience.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Minneapolis via Chicago,July 2017,1,1,1,,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,D Kline,3rd July 2017,"Verified Review | The absolute worst experience I've ever had on an airline. I've flown Delta or United my entire life but flying from Dallas to Atlanta, American seemed like the way to go. Wrong. My flight was delayed, the flight crew was unorganized and upon landing in Atlanta they somehow managed to take us to a gate that had a broken jetway. We then had to get towed to another gate after 30-45 minutes of waiting.

American Airlines,10,R Sanyal,2nd July 2017,"Verified Review | Flew from New York LGA to Chicago ORD on a flight that surpassed every expectation! It left and arrived on schedule. I had checked in a bag and it was on the luggage carousel soon after arrival. The in-flight service harkened back to the joyous days of flying. Two exceedingly courteous and solicitous flight attendants catered to the first class cabin whose 16 seats were all occupied. A full breakfast with choices was provided. Beverages were offered numerous times. Attendants came regularly to check on passenger wishes. Free giveaway headphones were offered to listen to music or watch a show on the drop down from the ceiling TV screens - no screens on the back of the seat in front. Bathroom was kept clean and tidy. A hot towel to refresh was another pleasant perk. Pilots kept us in the loop on the flight's progress. It was a very early morning flight on the first day of the month - the July issue of the inflight magazine was in the pocket and the crossword puzzle was quite engaging. The cabin was pleasant, spacious and clean with ample overhead space to stow bags. Very high performance by American Airlines!

American Airlines,2,Kanthi Rameswaram,30th June 2017,"Verified Review | I work in TX and work in NV, so I fly frequently Dallas DFW to Las Vegas, once every 2 weeks, and always by American Airlines because of the convenience (non-stop flight). AA is a Dallas Fort Worth based company. I am now a member of AA and a platinum Mastercard holder. I flew this morning (flight 542) in a seat that I upgraded paying $64. For this sum of money, I got to sit in 5C, a seat with a malfunctioning belt that refused to lock, I also got boarding privilege of Group 5 and my 2 bags were not the last to come out but close to last. It is an absolute disgrace that AA charges us $64 for an upgrade, for what? Did I mention the gate changes, on Sunday. I checked my gate online, and, I learnt that it was C10. The next day I got a boarding pass that said C7; while seated close to C7 we were told that it would be C8. Well we flew out of C24, I am glad I was paying attention, knowing that with this team anything was possible. AA is a very poorly run organization by people who are beyond caring. I think there were 2 seats in row 5 that had belts malfunctioning, 5C and 5E. Both the airline and DFW airport need a complete overhaul. Yes, everything in TX is big, but who gives a damn about dimensions, we want quality, we want efficiency.",,Business,Premium Economy,Dallas DFW to Las Vegas,June 2017,1,2,1,1,2,1,no
American Airlines,1,Angelina Scholefield,30th June 2017,"Verified Review | What can I say about American Airlines, well it's the worst airline I have flown with. I was meant to be flying from Las Vegas to Auckland via Los Angeles on 23 June 2017. It's now 26 June 2017 and I have only just got home. The first flight was delayed so I missed my connecting flight, and ended up being scheduled for the next flight 24 hours later. Found it difficult getting any help at LAX airport from AA, some staff told me to sleep on the floor, eventually I was put in a hotel for 2 nights but as I got there and gave my credit card we were promptly kicked out as the hotel was overbooked and they said American Airlines was coming to get us to take us to another hotel (there was 11 travellers in total) they never came. Had to make own way back to the airport. It was hot temperatures, and no one would provide us with bottled water. It took me an hour to get a $12 dinner voucher as I felt the $12 I got given wasnt good enough since $5 for a bottle of water at LAX. Got into Auckland airport eventually, no American Airlines staff anywhere to help. Went to baggage servies and they managed to get a staff member to talk to me.

So we had a major unexpected traffic delay while departing from New York causing the flight to arrive 2 hours behind schedule. Now of course I understand that the airline did not intentionally delay the flight however when asked for any assistance on booking a hotel, since I was told my flight was pushed over until the next morning, I was told by a representative both at the airport and on the phone that this was not their problem and just deal with it! Since I booked my trip through Expedia I gave them a call and they helped out with voucher covering a portion of my hotel fee as a courtesy which was very kind.

American Airlines,1,D Clarke,29th June 2017,"Verified Review | American Airlines is honestly one of the worst I've flown. My flight from Columbia to Los Angeles via Dallas was re-routed due to weather, which is fine, however passengers were told they could not leave the plane or else they wouldn't be able to get back on for over 3 hours. Finally we were allowed to fly again and the staff at the gate seemed to not know where to redirect everyone to. They simply didn't plan ahead in any sort of way. When I was able to get my ticket (because the layover plane I previously had a ticket for has left long before), I had to wait 2 more hours because the flight crew had not arrived. The plane was more and more delayed. Additionally, they gave no sort of accommodation to make up for the massive time gaps. They sat me and my father in the very back with no hope to move up due to their policy of overbooking. Hands down one of the worst airlines out there. They are unorganized and do not care in any way about the customer. They have no communication skills or ability to handle inconvenienced customers.

American Airlines,3,E Lydon,28th June 2017,"Verified Review | After a bad flight experience with American Airlines 3 years ago, I was pretty hesitant to fly with American again but it was the best option for my needs and I believe in second chances. I arrived in Washington DC at IAD 2 hours before my 7.20 am flight to find that it had been delayed to 10.30 am and my connecting flight in Dallas had subsequently been changed to accommodate for the delay. Even though I asked two employees, nobody could give a definitive answer as to why the flight was delayed 3 hours. I realize that these things happen and my connection had been altered so I wasn't too upset with the changes, but once it was time to board the now 10.30 am flight things started to de-escalate. They boarded some passengers and then stopped and made everyone get off the plane because, our pilot was missing! There was a major miscommunication about where the pilot was and the flight staff didn't have much information to tell us at first. We later found out that he was at least an hour away at another airport in DC. Knowing that I only had a 1 hour layover between my newly rebooked flights, I was panicking. We were finally allowed to re board our flight after many miscommunications about the pilots whereabouts and the flight attendants seemed to find the entire situation comical or maybe they were trying to lighten the mood for their unpleased passengers? The only saving grace in this story is the employee at the gate counter. Without her help I would have certainly missed my connection, but because of her tremendous efforts I was able to make my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Of course, the trip home wasn't quite as terrible, but again I only had one hour to catch my connection and the flight leaving Oklahoma City was 30 minutes late and again I made my connection by 5 minutes. The flights themselves weren't worse or better than average and there are some very helpful employees, but I'm going to steer clear from American Airlines from now on.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Oklahoma City,June 2017,3,2,,,2,1,no

Even though I have a small frame I found that the seating was cramped. There was not much leg room. The inflight entertainment was not working - no sound. There was no lighting (ie for reading) when the cabin lights were turned off at night.

American Airlines,4,T Leisch,24th June 2017,"Verified Review | London Heathrow to New York JFK. As we had missed our previous flight due to a delay, we had to be rebooked to a flight later that day which worked out fine. Having only frequently flown United to the US before, I was suprised by the friendly flight attendants. Inflight service and the IFE were fine. As the flights were on time. I appreciate that AA has refurbished thier Boeing 777 fleet and I really the ambient lightning and new IFE. However, cramping in another seat in every row (3-4-3 instead of 2-5-2) makes traveling really uncomfortable. As a 187 cm/88kg Person, the extremely narrow seats makes it always impossible to find a comfortable sitting position. Even our British Airways connecting service from HAM to LHR in an A320 had wider seats. Luckily, the flights from London to New York are not too long.

They told me that laptop is considered an additional bag and I have to shove it in my backpack to give the illusion that I am carrying 2 bags. On top of everything returning from Philadelphia I had a carry on bag full of glass souvenirs. They wanted me to check in the bag due to no overhead space. I had to empty my carry on to remove all the glass items for me to carry them on to the plane. Lord be hold, I walk on to the plane and there is plenty of room above.

American Airlines,2,Dean Bellville,21st June 2017,"Verified Review | I was scheduled on an American Airlines flight last night from Phoenix to Omaha. We boarded the flight and then was told there was a mechanical. Not a problem. I’m a million miler and understand. As soon as the problem was fixed the pilots timed out. Once again I totally understand. I don’t want a fatigued pilot flying the plane and it is an FAA rule that the airline can’t ignore. The problems started after all this. They said they were getting new pilots and it could take a couple of hours so they wanted everyone to deplane. At this point I’m not thrilled but at least we are going to make it to Omaha and I should be able to at least get in a half a day’s work the next day. We wait for two hours and still no pilots. They make an announcement that the pilots are coming in on a flight in 15 minutes and will be at the gate directly across from us. That was great news but a total lie. A few minutes later I hear someone on a radio say the pilots had never acknowledged the tag. My understanding is pilots never respond to these requests so I’m not sure why they even try or get the passengers hopes up. So the plane lands and deplanes I see the pilots get off and walk away. The gate has still not told anyone. About a half hour later the gate agent announces the flight is officially cancelled. The airline knew there was a shortage of pilots and no one ever accepts a tag so why did they hold us all captive for four hours after they knew the flight would cancel anyway. I would have been fine if as soon as the pilots timed out they cancelled the flight knowing they didn’t have any pilots to cover it. Things like this are why people hate airlines.

We finally boarded at 1am, sat there only for them to say the flight was now canceled with no valid reason. The Customer service agents were absolutely awful. Best part of this all is they tell us there are no flights to Charlotte until 10.45pm the following day which was also a lie, they would not offer hotel comp stating that it was weather related delay and they were not responsible for it. So we board a flight to NY, then to Boston get here only to be told that my luggage is in Charlotte and it arrived at 7am, somehow my luggage got here before I did.

She told me it was my fault for the missed connection and that I should not have booked the flights so close together. I tried to explain that it was a prepackaged AA flight connection that my travel agent booked. She put us on the next flight 2.5 hours later. That flight was nearly full and we were not able to sit next to each other. Also, I had paid for premium seats that we were not able to sit. The customer service agent also refused to refund the extra I paid for the premium seats. To top things off, the new connection flight was 40 minutes late taking off and arriving in Sacramento.

American Airlines,1,K Anderson,11th June 2017,"Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Salt Lake City to Chicago. After waiting for over thirty minutes after our flight was supposed to take off we found out that there was no crew for our flight. They then said that they were working on finding one. After two and a half hours they decided that our flight was then cancelled. We then had to wait to rebook and dealt with a very incompetent front desk lady. After it took her 45 minutes to rebook us we had to find a hotel, the airline didn't even offer to pay for it even though it was their fault our flight was cancelled. After a short night in a hotel we had to go back to the airport to catch our new flight. We had been told that we would all be sitting next to each other and that there wouldn't be any delays in our flights. We were mistaken. Once we landed in Phoenix we waited three hours before we even boarded our plane, this was after they did a last minute gate change. Even after we had to wait three hours for our flight, we had to sit on a hot plane for an hour and a half before it even took off. We had been told we would land in Chicago by 2 pm. We didn't arrive until 5.30pm. With myself being pregnant all of these changes, delays, and cancelations were very hard on my body. Not only did we have to pay for a hotel but we had to pay for an extra day on our long term parking. When I emailed this airline, they apologized and said that there wasn't anything they do with cancellations or delays. My husband and I have flown a lot. This was our first flight with American Airlines and it was terrible.

American Airlines,3,Alex Holt,10th June 2017,"Verified Review | Miami to Nashville. My husband and I were returning home from our wedding/ Honeymoon in St. Lucia on Flight AA4658 from Miami to Nashville and I was carrying my very expensive wedding dress on the plane. I had called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be a problem to hang it up before we left and was told that the flight attendant would help us find a place for my dress. We had been on four flights and on all of our flights except the last the flight attendants were helpful and polite. Our last flight was an absolute nightmare and everyone with us is very displeased with how poorly we were treated. The flight attendant introduced herself and she was extremely rude and condescending. Entering the plane we encountered the FA and asked if there was a place we could hang my wedding dress? She in return asked where we were seating, so we told her seats 12A and 12C. She curtly told us that because we were not flying first class she could not help us and we would have to put the dress in one of the overhead compartments. I was appalled by how dismissive she was. We quietly took our seats but I absolutely refused to shove my expensive dress above with all the other luggage, so we held the dress in our laps. Another flight attendant from the back came to greet us and was very sweet. She asked about the dress and we told her what happened. I told her how upset I was and she told us she would take care of it. A few moments later we saw her call up to the other flight attendant and it look like they were in a very heated altercation. Eventually the other flight attendant placed the dress in a hanging closed, but from that point on the first FA was even more rude than she was when we first entered the plane. Anytime she would walk by us she would make condescending remarks. When we were exiting the plane and asked for the dress she yet again make uncalled for remarks. We reached out to American airlines to complain about her unacceptable way of treating people, but we were only given a very generic cookie cutter response. We don't feel that American Airlines values customers that are not in their programs and we will not fly with them in the future.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Nashville,June 2017,3,1,1,,1,2,no

American Airlines,2,S Shaw,6th June 2017,"Verified Review | Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I have to say I don't think I will fly American ever again if I can help it. My experience today going back to Los Angeles was less than ideal. I was supposed to arrive back to L.A. on June 4th by 8pm PT because my flight was scheduled to leave 5:51pm ET. They delayed the flight 10 times before they canceled and changed the gate once which was just after midnight. So I waited seven hours just for them to keep delaying and to cancel. Guess what the reason was? The flight attendant was missing. They put me on another flight that was to leave out at 9:20 the next morning. That following morning we had a gate change and two delays but not by too many minutes. We did arrive on schedule to L.A. but guess what? My bag was kept on the original flight that was cancelled so my bag arrived to L.A before I did. I waited about an hour waiting on my bag at baggage claim thinking that they had it on the flight that I arrived on. I finally went to the back looking around to get answers as to why it was taking my bag so long. I looked at some bags they had positioned at the desk and guess what? One of those bags was mine. I could have saved an hour of time. They are horrible communicators. Very disappointed in my travel experience. The only good things that came out of this was that I arrived home safely, and they put me in a hotel for the night.

I flew with them back in December 2016 and I once again missed my connection flight due to mechanical problems that delayed us 2h. Never has American compensated me.

A huge plus were the Bose noise-cancelling headphones. The pillow was okay, blanket was great. The meal service was excellent - salad to start with warm nuts, great wine choices (I sampled the two whites) and a sea bass entree with pesto rice and carrots. The signature hot fudge sundae followed. The service was polite without being spectacular. I was able to take a nap just before we landed into LA (beautiful sunset landing).

Then to top it all off we get there today and they move our flight from 7:45 to 11 because the crew ""needs more rest"" - what about all of their customers who have been back and forth due to their lack of planning! Well on top of that they just moved us again to 12:45. No one will help us all they say is its out of their control.

American Airlines,2,M Callenas,3rd June 2017,"Verified Review | Miami to New York JFK. My experience with the American Airlines flight AA1048 (1 June 2017) was by far the worst experience I have had with any airline. Flight AA1048 was delayed over 4 hours (scheduled departure time was supposedly 3:30pm from Miami and arriving at JFK at 6:30pm), which resulted to my boyfriend and I not making our connecting flight to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. We ended up departing Miami airport at 7:30pm and arriving at JFK at 10:10pm at terminal 8. Our flight back home was scheduled to depart at 10:45pm at terminal 4 with Etihad Airlines. The staff at American Airlines (both at Miami and the JFK airport) had no concept of urgency, sensitivity or care to its passengers. Gate changes were made without clear announcements (D4 to D23) and passengers were not informed in a timely manner about reasons for the flight delay. Sporadic announcements were made when it was clear that passengers were becoming even more restless and agitated as their patience was being stretched beyond their capacity. One bit of information that was announced was that the plane was ready to leave however, the cabin crew was waiting for one flight attendant who was running late. This was actually ridiculous considering the flight was already late for 3 hours and she was still late. I do acknowledge that the pilot informed us in a timely manner the reasons for the further and ongoing delay, which was nice. Furthermore, I do also acknowledge his amazing pilot skills steering us through the crazy turbulence and landing the plane in such a smooth and gentle way. AA staff at JFK were rude, abrupt and showed no courtesy. After the plane landed, my boyfriend and I tried to get off the flight as soon as possible and when we managed to get through to the gate front desk, I spoke to a lady explaining to her that my boyfriend and I had a flight in 45min but she just brushed us off and said that since we didn't book the connecting flight with AA, there's nothing they can do. I asked her if it was possible if she could call the other terminal to notify them that we were on the way and she just said, ""Nope we can't do that and there's no way and that we missed our flight considering the time involved with baggage claim"". We asked her how to get to terminal 4 and what was the fastest way and she just advised ""go up that way and follow the signs"" in her monotone. She provided no equitable solution, not even extended a small kind gesture to appease our frustration as it was clear she did not understand the concept of customer service.",Boeing 757-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New York JFK,June 2017,3,2,2,,1,2,no

Let me first say that American has long been my carrier of choice which is evident via my over 300,000 miles logged in the past 5 years (splitting time with Delta and SouthWest too). However, recent changes will be the driving factor for my migration to a new primary carrier. I don't mind the ability to buy premium seating but it has now grown out of control. American now intentionally forces me in a seat that is not my preference just so they can sucker me into paying for my desired position. The additional requirements preventing carry on baggage for economy coach, again could be bearable but only if the carrier holds itself to a higher turnaround time (which it does not).

They were very arrogant, and gave me a hard time, in fact I had to beg them to give me another ticket on the next flight. I sent a complaint into American Airlines and all they said was ""sorry, hope your next experience will be better"". No compensation, just excuses. I sent in verification of my arrival on time, but they just ignored it. This is the worst customer service I have had with an airline.

While most crew members just did the bare necessary, service was overall fine, and especially on the way back some of the crew were genuinely friendly and seemed to enjoy their work, especially the more senior crew members, contrary to what I expected from other reviews. Food was alright (except for horrible, cold, way too salty mid-flight sandwiches) somewhat better out of NRT, soft drinks, wine, and several beers free. Three drink rounds per meal were plenty.

The total delay time was 27 hours. When I arrived in Lima from Dallas I was told my connecting ticket did not exist - I was told my ticket, and the ticket of my wife, that we had paid for, did not exist. I was then directed by Latam airlines (connecting airlines) to an American Airlines office; sadly no one was working at this office at 4 pm. I was then directed to call a local number; no one answered the line. I then used my cell phone to make an hour long international call, costing me 100 dollars (I have the bill) for my flight to be rescheduled for 10 hours later. So, 2 nights later, with about 6 hours total sleep time, my wife and I arrived at our final destination. The trip took 36 hours instead of 12. Of course, this completely changed our plans, cost me money, and caused me to experience a health problem. When I described my travel difficulties to an American Airlines representative, I was told that there were no guidelines that would fulfill my request for a refund. I was told that these types of problems, including forgetting to schedule a connecting flight when the original flight is delayed, are within what is considered normal operating procedures. I was awarded a number of airline miles. I have never experienced this kind of service. I have never written an online review of an airline. And I will never fly this airline again.

American Airlines,1,D Verdin,23rd May 2017,"Verified Review | Denver to Buffalo. I'm not one who is usually compelled to write a review but the service I experienced this weekend flying on American Airlines was so horrible that I had to. It all began when I believed I left my debit card at the ticketing counter when I paid to check my bag. After exiting security and returning to the check in area, I approached an attendant and kindly asked him if anyone had turned in a debit card as I had lost mine, the guy doesn't even look up from what he is doing and rudely yells ""did anyone turn in a debit card? No?"" Then looks at me and says ""retrace your steps, it's not my problem."" Finally I get past security and to my gate, we board the plane and begin to take off. A passenger gets sick before we even take off so we return to the gate, completely understandable. After waiting for 30 minutes for them to clean up, we are informed that they need to ""wax the plane down"" which took another 45 minutes. It was at this point that the pilot stated that he informed all AA crew we were delayed so we could get to our connecting flights in Charlotte. 45 minutes into the ""waxing"" we were informed we were returning to the gate yet again due to possible damage to the tail. I needed to get to Buffalo that night due to an important engagement early the next day so I decided to exit the plane and attempt to get on another flight that night. The flight attendant rudely stated overhead that anyone exiting the plane would not be welcome back on if they took off soon. My last straw was booking another flight and due to AA already rebooking my Charlotte flight for the next evening, they were refusing to put me on a flight that left that night so I had to repurchase another ticket with the ""possibility of a refund"" which was eventually denied. Everyone from the checkin counter to the flight attendants and gate staff were awful. I don't even think they know what being polite or a smile is. On top of it, my bags were lost and I received them the day I returned back to Denver. I paid for extra seating and another ticket and they still will not refund me. Never flying this airline again.

I have an extra three hours to wait at the airport and write this review because I was bumped from my connecting flight without any notice or compensation. The first flight was delayed an hour and fifteen minutes due to mechanical issues. Apparaty a bird had crashed into the plane the night before. So rather than have the issue fixed before takeoff, they make an entire plane full of passengers wait on a hot, sticky plane for an hour. Because the plane departed late American Airlines rebooked all passengers with connecting flights. I was one of them, the problem is that my connecting flight was delayed so I made the flight with time to spare. The aircraft didn't even change, the same plane I took on the first flight was also the same plane I would have taken for the second flight. But did American Airlines care? No! They bumped me from the flight I was supposed to be on and gave my seat away. The flight was of course overbooked - as per usual for American Airlines. After being treated rudely by the gate manager I went to customer service to ask for a refund (I knew I wouldn't get it but hey, never hurts to ask) and was told the best he could offer was a $12 meal voucher.

This was a late evening flight that got delayed by half an hour (and for the first time on American I heard the pilot actually acknowledge and apologize). Security at O'Hare was a bit of a zoo and most food outlets were shutting down as I got through. Since I have status and the cost would be $80 I paid for two 500 mile upgrade vouchers in the hope of getting bumped. My seat was already in main cabin extra with reasonable legroom, and I fly this route at least monthly but given the late hour and my hunger I thought I would enjoy an upgrade. The product was very disappointing and not worth $80. We were offered nuts which I can't eat due to an allergy. I was given a snack pack as an alternative. I was in seat 3E, legroom wasn't amazing. Seat comfort was ok but nothing special. I had a couple of drinks. Food and beverage value maybe $35 for a snack pack and a couple of whiskies (but they often comp your second if you buy two in economy so not that good).

American Airlines,2,David Giampietro,19th May 2017,"Verified Review | Palm Springs to Boston via Phoenix with American Airlines and American Eagle. This airline assumes no responsibility for the services that it sells to their customers. Three of us left Palm Springs (flight AA3076) on a beautiful day with hopes of connecting to our flight in Phoenix that was to bring us back to Boston (flight AA2341). Upon arrival to Phoenix our flight was running late, the flight attendant was aware of 2 groups of people with tight connections and all they did was to tell the plane to let those with tight connections to get off 1st and both groups were in the back of the airplane. We know how that worked out, we all got off last. They did not call the tower to say we were running late as reported to me by the person at the gate for Boston. There was only 30 minutes between reported landing time in Phoenix and lift off time to Boston if the 1st flight arrived on time. The gates were over 1/2 mile apart. I was the youngest in our group of three turning 65 this year and the oldest was 82. This information is all known by the airline upon booking a ticket on line. I ran to the gate for flight AA2341 and was told the doors were closed and are always closed 15 minutes before take off. I asked if she could call to see if the doors could be opened and she refused. The plane did not disconnect from gate for at least 6 more minutes. How is an 82 year old man suppose to walk 1/2 + miles to a connecting flight when seated in the back of the plane which takes 6-10 minutes to get out of allowing only 5-9 minutes of walking time (if it lands on time and it did not)? At the service desk rule 240 was not applied which entitles us to the first flight to Boston on any airline not just American which we were forced to do getting us home an entire day late. I emailed to customer relations who responded in a way that was unacceptable (basically saying sorry but there is nothing that can be done). I asked her to have a supervisor get back to me and not one response has been sent my way in over 2 weeks.

American Airlines,7,Pav Paul,12th May 2017,"Verified Review | London to Colorado Springs via Dallas. After reading the reviews, before my flight earlier this month, I was concerned to say the least. Dreading my upcoming flight almost. But, after having flown Delta to Colorado Springs in December 2016. I am pleased to be able to say the conditions on AA main cabin were as good as, if not better in one area, as Delta. I can't actually see the justification for bad reviews in main cabin. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The seat pitch was fine. I would go as far to say I feel like I had more leg room on AA than I did on Delta, but the seat width is noticeably less than other flights I've been on. Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you. I was contemplating paying extra for main cabin extra, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. I would save your money as I couldn't see any significant difference in leg room, although it's supposed to provide an additional 6 inches. I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable. Not the best economy experience I've had, but acceptable. Cabin crew service was polite and friendly. Nothing really to comment on over and above what's expected. IFE was actually quite good. Lots of choice with current and classic movie choices. Overall. Not a bad experience. Certainly better than I expected.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Colorado Springs via Dallas,May 2017,4,4,3,5,4,3,yes

I went to the counter and asked if I was at the right gate, and they said yes, but they couldn't change the sign because the plane that was at that gate wasn't able to pull out. They didn't give much of an explanation, but our aircraft was there, but wasn't able to get to the gate. At no point did they give an announcement to inform the customers. Eventually they re-routed the flight to the next gate and everyone deplaned. I knew I would miss my next flight, so I was able to get a new ticket from another counter prior to departing. When I got to Dallas I went to the customer service counter and despite a line that extended down the airport corridor, there were only 2 attendants present. Surprised me since they knew how many people missed flights with the three aircraft that were late arrivals. Eventually they did get other attendants, but it took 1.5 hours to get to the counter.

American Airlines,2,J Hardwick,9th May 2017,"Verified Review | My flight was cancelled from Hong Kong to LAX. I understand this happens and is often out of control of the airline. However, the organisation at the airport was awful as there is no American Airlines desk in Hong Kong airport so a lot of waiting around with nobody telling us what was going to happen. I had two onward flights to catch, one connecting from LAX-JFK with American Airlines and one the following day with JetBlue. As the delay got pushed back further and further (more than 15hrs) with the first leg, it turned out I was missing both connections. I called up AA and they would offer no compensation for this delay. At this point I had paid a change of flight fee to JetBlue and had paid for a hotel in New York. In the end, after not backing down, they said they would issue me a $300 voucher for use on AA. However, they will only issue the voucher by post. 8 weeks went by, no voucher.

About an hour or so before my flight I was notified that my flight was delayed until 9:15pm which meant I would miss my connecting flight. When I went to the ticket counter, there was no rep there. I waiting with another passenger for around 30 min before a rep showed up. When I was finally able to ask her what was going on with my flight she informed me that they had canceled the flight and that it would be leaving the following morning. When I asked her why she said they didn't have enough people to man the flight. I asked her to put me on another flight, but there were no more flights that day. Keep in mind this was around 6pm.

At that point I unloaded on her and her horrible customer service and went to Delta and bought another ticket for $171.38. When I called AA to get a refund they told me it would take up to 10 days and that they couldn't tell me what amount would be refunded. I waited 11 days with no refund. When I called back in to AA they said no one had filled the refund. Once again I had to go through the process and wait. I finally go a notice that my refund of $115 was being ""processed"" but could take up to 5 days to complete. When I reached someone in customer service they seemed very unapologetic, like I was a nuisance. I tried to get someone to explain to me why my refund, which should have been $214 because of the seats I purchased, was so low they said, ""that is the amount our refund department issues.""

I am currently stuck in the Dallas airport because I could not run across airport fast enough. My first flight was 34 minutes late due to its departure from Dallas. We land in Dallas I run ( yes as people made comments about me running). I get to the gate before listed departure but 7 minutes after flight is closed. The funniest part is took me 6 minutes to get from gate to gate but I was 7 minutes late and I couldn't run fast enough? WTF I don't know or have ever seen someone run so fast time went backwards-have you? They didn't hold flight 1 minute for me even though they knew I was there trying to get on flight but running late because of them American not me. Basically flights with connections are just bait to get your money when they don't care about you. Then the 2nd flight is with an American partner (American Eagle) who says there is nothing they can do for me as my reason for missing the flight is not there fault but can get me a discount hotel room for $100 a night and put me on the first flight in the morning.

Therefore I had mixed feelings concerning my connecting flight from JFK to Boston during Easter Holiday. I shouldn't have worried at all. The gate was close to the Admiral's Lounge at Terminal 8 and I was able to spot the aircraft while being seated in the so called ""bureau""-section. Boarding started well ahead of the actual departure time and there seemed to be a very light load on this short hop to Boston. I only noticed upon boarding that this aircraft had a three-cabin-configuration and is usually used for transcontinental flights. As a frequent flyer I was assigned a seat in the C-class section. I was able to stretch out and use the interactive map. Doors were closed 15 minutes before departure and there were no delays on the tarmac and runway either. The friendly crew even managed to serve all passengers a softdrink and a cookie. Take notice: This was a 42-minutes-flight only.

Cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 hours to resurface one and a half hours before landing to serve a snack. There was no cabin crew interaction with fare paying passengers for the majority of both flights. There was no provision of water to keep passengers hydrated for an exceptionally long flight. There were no young staff as part of the cabin crew. I have been told the more mature cabin crew are very obsessive over staffing the long haul routes. What a shame. Pity they lack customer service.

This year (last week) I was scheduled to fly out at 5:50pm. got to the airport to check in, and my flight had been canceled due to the AC on the plane being broken - they couldn't schedule me for another flight out until the next morning. Also, rescheduling resulted in adding an additional stop to my trip. I missed an entire day of this vacation, and had to cancel reservations as a result. They gave me a $200 voucher. Seriously? I don't even want to fly with them again. what good is a voucher going to do? Disgusting!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Roanoke to Portland,April 2017,2,3,3,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Shannon Champion,19th April 2017,"Verified Review | I just returned form the trip that I took from Saint Louis to Washington Reagan. American Airlines totally ruined the trip. Not only did we not get to DC in time to do anything, the same thing happened on the return flight home. Our flight was delayed and we did not get home until after midnight. We sat at both airports watching American Airlines flights being delayed and canceled. We were not the only ones. I will never fly AA again. Basically anyone was fortunate if they left on time. I was totally shocked. I really almost feel sorry for the gate personnel. It is no wonder that were telling people that “It is just your tough luck”, they have to be ashamed and sick of it themselves. While waiting in St. Louis, the gate personnel did not want to give out meal vouchers. One lady apparently aware that after such a wait that we were entitled to meal vouchers got up and asked for the meal voucher, the gate personnel whispered, “If I give you one I have to give everyone one.” Let me tell you about a similar experience I had with Southwest Airlines recently. The same delay happened and after a couple of hours the gate personnel started playing a game with everyone at the gate. They started giving mileage vouchers for the delay. I have flown for years and I have never had such incompetent, terrible service. The only way I will ever fly AA again would be that it is my only option and I have to use AA.",,Business,Business Class,Saint Louis to Washington Reagan,February 2017,1,1,1,,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,S Verola,17th April 2017,"Verified Review | El Paso to Chicago. Due to my claustrophobic issues, this was my first flight since 2010. Arriving from Chicago to El Paso the flight was decent because i had the air vent full blast which helped from feeling anxiety; but returning home was a emotional disaster. I paid $90 for me and my husband for leg room and just to find that the only seats available in the main cabin had a low overhead, the air vent had hardly any pressure, tight seat belts, and I was continually bumped every time stewardess pass. After everyone boarded and a few minutes afterwards, the captain announced there was engine problem and there would be a delay. Immediately I began to panic because I couldn't get the air vent to work. I informed the stewardess several times with tears steaming down my face, that I was freaking out and I needed air, and she informs me that once the plane took off, I would get more air. After waiting 30 long minutes on the runway, the plane finally took off and a guy sitting next row saw the panic and my knees shaking, he attempted to help with the air vent. There were four empty seats in front of me and not once did either cabin staff attempt to accommodate nor ask me why I was crying. Meantime my husband tried to fix the air vent but to no avail. Also the low overhead was so inconvenient and with me crying, he tried to fan me with a magazine, so I know he was miserable as well.

American Airlines,1,Lauren Gargiulo,16th April 2017,"Verified Review | Philadelphia to Orlando return and will never fly American Airlines again. A horrendous experience! My family and I were taking our first family vacation in 20 years, as there are 9 of us, we booked our flight almost a year in advance to ensure that we would sit together, especially since my 2 year old niece would be coming as well and it was her first time flying. About a month before our trip we were told that all of our seats were changed and none of us could sit together. They had my 2 year old niece sitting in a seat alone. When we called to sort this out we encountered nothing but pure rudeness and constant transfers. After 4 hours (no exaggeration) on the phone trying to just change one seat so my niece wasn't alone, we were told there was nothing we could do and would have to try and change our seat at the airport, mere hours before we were supposed to take off and that nothing was guaranteed. We started out in Philly, flying to Orlando. The entire staff was rude, yelling at passengers as we tried to board the plane telling us that we had to check our carry on bags because there was no space left on the plane. After all the chaos, she was able to sit with her daughter and a nice man switched seats with her husband, so my niece was able to fly with both her parents by her side. Once we got on board there was plenty of room for additional carry ons, some overhead compartments were completely empty. We had a wonderful vacation and then on the flight back home we had the same issue. My entire family was spread throughout the plane and once again my 2 year old niece was booked in a seat alone. The staff on the flight coming home were much nicer and much more accommodating but it wasn't confirmed that my sister would be able to sit with her daughter until literally 1 minute before we boarded. As we were attempting to switch her seats we met several other families that had the same issues as we did. Countless children 7 and younger were seated alone and apart from their families. And AA didn't extend an apology nor an explanation as to why they needed to separate everyone. I will never fly this airline again. I'd much rather give my hard earned money to an airline that would accommodate my family and I.

I was an air stewardess in my younger days and since travelled with a number of airlines with their cabin crew being smart and well presented.

At around 7.00 pm, the pilot announced that the First Officer's flight had barely taken off and hopefully we could depart by 8 pm.

There were other passengers standing around her - clearly waiting for her to finish. But not only did she not pay attention to any of us, but when I gently asked if I could just grab the water and pour it myself, she glared and almost shouted at me - ""Can you not see that I'm in the middle of something!"" Then she thrust the bottle into my hands and as I turned away she said, ""Hold up! Where do you think you are going with that bottle of water!""

When she came to my row (which is not far from the front), I used my most friendly voice to ask her could she tell me what kind of sandwich are were. To my surprise, she gave out a loud and exasperated sigh - turned to ask her colleague about the type of sandwich, turned to me and said, ""it's turkey, turkey!""

She calmed me well, but explained that I couldnt leave the plane. Another staff came up and inquired what was wrong. I told them I needed to leave and get my phone, thinking I hopefully left it by the gate or the small store across the hall. He walked out and some minutes later returned with my phone.

American Airlines,1,Rich Claar,30th March 2017,"Verified Review | American Airlines flight from Milwaukee to Chicago was showing as delayed by 35 minutes upon our arrival to airport. No problem as we had 1 x 2.5 hour layover for a connecting flight. However, time went on and the departure time kept getting extended for no reason given. We were instructed that the flight would still occur. When the flight showed a departure time of 9.51 (almost 2 hours past its original time - and keep in mind the flight is only a 45 minute flight from Milwaukee to Chicago), I went up to find out what was going on. Fortunately a pilot was there and told me that the 1st plane had mechanical issues and then another was sent for and it returned for mechanical issues and that they were looking for another plane. They were talking about getting a bus to send passengers to Chicago. Unfortunately, that would no longer be an option as it would take at least 2 hours to drive, park and get to gate - which means we would be missing our connecting flight. Why didn't someone make that decision sooner - or at least let us know as I could have driven to Chicago or got my own transportation. No communication. When a gate agent finally arrived, she said she could change our flight to get us to our destination, but it was not leaving until 4 pm (we had been at the airport since 6.20 am). So now we had to wait until 4 pm to leave and it was 10 am at that point. We were later given some food vouchers by a ticketing agent as the gate agent seemed to think that this was normal for AA and she agreed with us but there was nothing she could do. When we tried to use the vouchers - which states only good for food and beverages - at Nonna's restaurant, they refused to honor part of it as we had two drinks with our food and they stated that it did not include alcoholic beverages - which it does not state on the voucher anywhere. Again, more issues. We finally arrived at our destination over 7 hours late (which is big in a short 4 day vacation). The experience was terrible all around.

American Airlines,1,E Klimen,30th March 2017,"Verified Review | My university booked 45 people on a flight from New York JFK to Santiago, Chile, with a layover in Miami. When we arrived at the airport (luckily with plenty of time), the kiosks could not process our confirmation code and many of us got error codes. Customer service slowly and painfully manually checked us all in and took our luggage. When returning from Santiago, we arrived at the airport ready to encounter the same issue. This time, the kiosks once again did not work, but the customer assistance agent would not let us all enter the line to get manually checked in. Instead, they roped off the entrance to the EMPTY line and ""had to talk to the manager first."" We explained that there were 45 people under one reservation code and the kiosks would not check us in, but they were adamant about having each of us wait for the kiosk to give us an error code and then get in line for customer service. I explained that we would all miss our flight if all of us had to wait in line for a kiosk, error code, and then for customer assistance. After ""talking to the manager,"" the agent offered to check half of us in, not that this makes any sense because all 45 of us had a ticket number to board the same plane. Finally, after ignoring the agent and just entering the line, our bus driver came to argue with them as well to let the rest of the group through. The agents denied that 45 could possibly be under one confirmation code and have a group reservation (Why else would 45 people show up at the airport together?). Eventually, they let everyone through, did not find more agents to assist the line, and clearly had not communication amongst themselves. Luckily, everyone got through security in time for the flight, but I'm sure if some of us hadn't just ignored them all together, some would not have.

So now at this moment we are on the airplane waiting to depart and waiting on the runway for 30 mins - at this point we are delayed by 4.5 hours for a flight that only takes 30 Mins.

Managed quite a number of hours of sleep. Food service and choice was more than adequate and of course the highlight was the sundae for dessert. However for breakfast they ran out of the egg option and had to settle for fruit and granola on both routes. Service was friendly and efficient. Late night snacks are available on demand and was good. The Bose noise reduction earphones were really effective, but the disposable ear-pieces on the short haul flights were not worth using. I have already booked another flight with AA in April from JFK to Lima Peru.

American Airlines,1,Shirley Westbrook,16th March 2017,"Verified Review | St. Louis to Chicago. I’m completely devastated. My husband and I have been married for three years, but we never had a honeymoon. So we saved up our money to decide where we would go within the next five years. He had to have major surgery, so we scheduled for this year. He’s never flown before and was excited and anxious. We made a reservation with Carnival Cruise to coincide with our anniversary but before his surgery, because life is short. Everything was fine as we filled up our Expedition for the two hour drive to Lambert Airport. We found parking and got on the park shuttle. I knew a little bit from prior experience, but my husband was worried and nervous. The first thing out of place I noticed was when we were at the gate waiting to board. The captain and crew got on about ten minutes before we were called to board. There was a request for anyone with a carryon with wheels to check them at the desk due to a full plane. As we boarded I noticed the captain laughing and holding a conversation with two flight attendants already aboard. Then the problems started. It took a while because the flight attendants were trying to find space overhead for everyone’s carry-ons (we didn’t have any.) The captain taxied off, then stopped. He told us we had to wait awhile for the plane to be de-iced. (That took 50 minutes.) He taxied again and went around three times. Finally, he told us that his compass wasn’t aligned and he needed to have maintenance take a look at it. But, there was no gate available, so we would have to wait until one opened for him to dock. (That took another 30 minutes.) During this wait, one of the female flight attendants told us to call or go online to rebook if we had connecting flights out of Chicago. I called immediately and was told by a representative she could not rebook us while we were still on the plane. I explained that we needed to catch our connecting flight from Chicago at 8:30am and if we missed it we would miss our cruise. Absolutely no sympathy given. Finally we docked. After 30 more minutes of uncertainty, the captain told us the plane is being put out of service. I called the cruise line for help to get to our port in Miami, while my husband called American Airlines to see what can be done. We got off the plane and was told little to no info. We asked where our luggage would be and told it would be held until we had another flight. The rep found us another flight, but it would make it there after the cruise had already departed. Mind you, one flight had already boarded and ready to leave at 7:19am. Too bad we were stuck on the tarmac. The cruise line couldn’t find a plane for us because all flights were booked and full. We made several phone calls trying to salvage our delayed honeymoon to no avail. Finally, we accepted defeat and requested a refund and looked for our luggage. This turned into another time consuming ordeal. We drove back home dejected. It was a very quiet two hour drive. We had a million questions and no answers. I called the cruise line as soon as we got home to see if we could book another one. I found one sailing 3/16/17 after working with a remarkable woman. Unfortunately, there were no flights available. I accepted defeat once again and was given options that made it worse. I couldn't add the rest of the letter I sent them both.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Chicago,March 2017,1,1,,,1,2,no
American Airlines,1,Laila Zoummane,14th March 2017,"Unverified | I have had the worst experience flying American Airlines. My flight was on 3/10/17 from Madison to Chicago with a connecting flight from Chicago to Dayton. My flight from Madison was at 2.56 pm, then it was delayed to 4.30, then to 6 and to 7 and 7.30. After I arrived to Chicago my flight to Dayton was cancelled due to no crew. The person who helped me with rebooking told me that I have an option to buy another ticket. This made me furious, what should I buy another ticked for a cancelled flight? He rebooked a flight from Chicago to Philadelphia and from Philadelphia to Dayton. He gave me a voucher for food which was not enough and had to pay extra money out of my pocket. The hotel was in Schaumburg and had to take a taxi back to the airport at 2.30 am as the shuttle did not start until 6 am. It cost me $75 for the taxi. I will never fly with American Airlines. It was a nightmare experience.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madison to Dayton via Chicago,March 2017,3,2,,,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,C Kemp,14th March 2017,"Verified Review | Cincinnati to Atlanta. I have to say, I haven't flown American Airlines in over 20 years. I found a great ticket price and thought the drive to Cincinatti was worth the hundred dollars I saved however, the experience is one I will never forget. The best I can say is you get what you pay for. Although the inflight service was excellent in the old planes and the flight attendants were warm and grand, the check-in counter people are subpar and definitely not worth the hassle of traveling with the company. I have chosen to just pay the extra dollars, plan ahead of time, and never fly with American Airlines again. The online response team gets back to you quickly with a response. However, the experience of the check-in counter people is amazing to me. They are slow. Which in my observation is not a ticket counter issue but a archaic technology issue. For sure you need to get to the airport 1.5 hours early because simply checking in takes 15-20 minutes per person. I didn't see anyone come to the front and get thru their process swiftly. As management chooses to assist who they want to assist with great customer service, I can truly say you should choose a different company if you want quality.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinatti to Atlanta,March 2017,4,5,2,2,1,2,no

American Airlines,1,K Caws,13th March 2017,"Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Denver to Liberia via Miami. I had eight people on a flight for my wedding to Costa Rica through Miami. They boarded the plane 15 minutes early (of course we were delayed taking off for 45 minutes) so when we arrived at the designated boarding time the agent informs us our carry on bags will have to be checked. When I say that's fine but ask if anything can be done about the wedding dress she immediately becomes rude saying we should have been there on time. Apparently we should have known they were boarding early. She demands the boarding passes if we want to make the flight at all. As I am trying to get all 8 separated from the connecting flight boarding passes she threatens to keep me off the plane ""if I throw one more boarding pass at her"". I was sliding them off the stack of paper I was holding onto the counter. None touched her or even went to the edge. She comes around the counter to tag our bags telling me I would have had to check mine anyway. I responded that I've never had any problem with it as a carry on in 5 years with numerous airlines. She pointed to the expander zippers being opened as her rationale. I took the boarding passes from her and she said that she could keep me off the plane until I cooled down and that she was going to tell the pilot about me. I did not raise my voice, curse, or even argue at any point throughout this encounter. I said nothing and boarded the flight as I needed to get to my wedding. Once onboard there were at least 5 overhead compartments with room for the dress. Begging the flight attendants did absolutely nothing and they closed the half full compartments. After talking to several other people apparently we were no the only people treated poorly by the desk agent. However, repeated attempts to file a complaint with American have resulted in nothing more than a complete brush off.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Liberia via Miami,March 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,A Anderson,6th March 2017,"Verified Review | The worst customer service from American Airlines flying from New Orleans to Dallas. These people have no respect for the passengers. There is no one to talk to. They checked in my husband's and my carry-on bags at the gate due to the limited space in the cabin (even though each of us had one personal item and small carry on) they promised that they would return us the baggage in Dallas as we had to stay over night because of the connection. We arrived but the baggage wasn't there. They sent us from Terminsl C to Terminal D to receive the baggage. Arriving at the baggage claim area, there was a staff member who wasn't willing to help at all. He was calling some customer service counter where nobody was available pretending that he was doing something. As I was furious, we asked for a supervisor, then he called someone else, again we had to repeat the story. Anyway, after 4 hours of waiting in the airport we received our bag and could finally leave to the hotel to get some rest. In the morning, went back to the airport for the next flight, asked for a supervisor. The lady wasn't even willing to talk to us. She was looking around as we were complaining and stopped us saying you only talk about ""negatives"" I can't do anything about it. There was 3 other people with different problems over there.

The thing looks great, lots of storage space, great in flight entertainment system and very decent food. Staff was pleasant. It all went a bit downhill when I tried to sleep. The seat is awkward and asymmetrical when flat. It's very hard and really tight in places. In my case, seat 2D, the left armrest goes down while the right is fixed meaning great shoulder space on your left and squuezed in on the right. There is a big pad on the right side of the seatbelt which gets in your way every time you turn over. Also the tray does not stow away which means you bang your knee every time you turn. When lying on your side one side is quite restricted with regards to bending your knee.

From the moment I was in line at Houston IAH to head to my destination, to my return to Houston, the people that represent AA lacked customer service skills. The officer reviewing passports at IAH was extremely rude and sarcastic to every person that went through her line. She talked down to paying passengers with no provocation from them. She was making it clear to passengers that she had been there since 2:30 am. Perhaps she needs to find another position more suited to her so that she does not take out her displeasure with her work schedule on paying and unsuspecting passengers. On my return flight, my bag did not arrive on the same plane as I had. It was delivered the next day. At home when I opened my suitcase, I noticed that I was missing a bag of clothes.

American Airlines,1,N McGhee,3rd March 2017,"Verified Review | I purchased a flight from American Airlines from San José SJO to Washington with an 18 hour layover in Dallas, thinking that missing a day of work would be worth the money I saved in ticket prices. We were charged to recheck our luggage in Dallas before being allowed to board our flight to Houston, even though this policy is listed nowhere on the AA website or in any of the emails I received from them, not even in the fine print. We were basically extorted $65 with no alternative option other than to leave our professional equipment behind or lose our seats on the non-refundable flight. This was such a blatant scam, I am honestly appalled that something like this can even happen. Also, good luck ever getting ahold of a human being - we called customer service and they wouldn't even talk to us. We had to express all of our concerns over email.

The plane was rammed as pretty much always but the saving grace was the seat back TV's with quality programming. As a family of 5 we don't have screens each, let alone travel with that many, as much as AA asserts that 90% of passengers do. Also benefitted from a very attentive and friendly FA who went out of her way to get me some milk, as opposed to cream, for my tea. Contrasting experience to 2 years ago on a flight with AA when I was literally scolded for asking that the cream not be put in to the hot water before a tea bag was put in. This was the 4th AA flight and 3 of those included FAs who were very much not part of the normal experience. Food options are seriously challenging for those unable to grab something before the flight. 4 of us opted for the $10 cheese platter which is about the best thing on offer.

Due to several fight delays, I missed every single one of my connecting flights putting me into my final destination the following day. I explained to the counter and customer service reps that I was active duty, and needed to arrive the same day. There was nothing AA could do.

American Airlines,1,Scott McGonigal,17th February 2017,"Verified Review | Philadelphia to Cancun. I had booked a flight with American Airlines and the flight ended being changed to later times. I was on my way to my honeymoon with my wife and we had previously reserved seats for them to be together. After realizing that these time changes were huge inconviences their customer service refused to allow for us to schedule our seats together and insisted we needed to pay a 100$ fee in order to get two seats together. Due to the change, the fact that there were already seats scheduled to be together on the previous flight, and the fact that we were taking their airline to Dublin, Ireland once we got back and they still did not budge proves that they do not care about their customers. For those who are not flying on their business credit card sure seem to be worthless in their corporate eyes. I could not be more disappointed with their customer service department or lack of its existence. This experience has definitely led me to start doing more research on airlines that I travel on.

They never updated the board or contacted me to let me know that apparently, to the American Airline customer service that the flight left around 5pm.

In the event, the flight was only 15 minutes late in departing. It was a bumpy flight but the flight attendant came by frequently with a basket of snacks and offers of alcoholic drinks. Connecting in Charlotte required a bit of a walk through crowded concourses and the flight to JFK took off on time and arrived almost 20 minutes before schedule! Again, very friendly service with repeated servings (alas) of the same snacks and drinks. Seats on both flights were comfortable and there was a modern entertainment system on the back of the front seat with a decent selection of shows. I merely followed the travel map tracking the flight. All in all, the flights and the crew belied my apprehensions. It is clear that there is great inconsistency by flights and crew.

American Airlines,1,Gordon Matthews,9th February 2017,"Verified Review | I flew from London to Miami via British Airways which was a superb flight. Then I had a connection from Miami to Montevideo using American Airlines. The difference between these 2 experiences was staggering. When I finally cleared imigration in Miami (although I was in transit) which took over 2 hours I went to the business class lounge the staff were pleasant and the lounge not too bad but the food was minimal and not up to business class standard and I was given a voucher for 2 drinks. I use lounges all over the world and this is the first one I have ever used that expected you to pay for your drinks. I don't think American Airlines have any idea what business class passengers expect and I doubt if they care. We then went to the gate although they don't give you any information when you should go. When we arrived at the gate we had our boarding passes that had been issued in London (I was travelling with my brother) I went through fine but they stopped my brother and told him they had changed his seat. I asked the incompetent at the gate why? No apology in any form I was just told it was nothing to do with him and he couldn't do anything. I asked for the purser once on board and these 2 women turned up one was the purser and one was ground crew when we explained that we were not happy that this had happened they again gave no apology and said they it wasn't to do with them and what did they expect me to do throw people out of their seats? (ironic as this is just what they did to us). When we pointed out that there was something wrong with a system that allowed this to happen the purser got defensive and threatened to have us thrown off the aircraft. Just bullying us. All the time this was happening this was stood up in front of all the passengers a very unpleasant experience and dreadful customer service. The plane was tired, narrow seats that when you tried to lie down you felt that you were in a coffin, no built in entertainment centre, I didn't eat dinner but had breakfast which was appalling. All the crew were wearing different clothes so they had no attention to detail and no uniform in the true sense of the word.This is the worst airline I have ever flown. I am now 60 and I have being flying since I was 7.

American Airlines,2,Kara Hollenbeck,7th February 2017,"Unverified | Philadelphia to San Francisco. My flight was delayed in Philadelphia for an hour, which caused me to missed my connecting flight in San Francisco to Sydney. After contacting American Airlines before touchdown in San Francisco, I was informed that they would put me up in a hotel and my flight would be changed to the next night. When I arrived at the terminal in San Francisco, I went to the American Airline desk and asked who I could talk to about my accommodation due to my missed flight. The first thing the women, who ended up being a supervisor, said to me was ""Well what time is your flight?"" I responded and told her that my flight to Sydney was supposed to depart at 11:25 pm -- her response, ""Well, it's only 10:50"". From there on I was in complete shock, what kind of response is that? I felt as though she was making assumptions about what I knew/ did not know before even asking me my name or flight number. I explained to her that I was already booked on another flight for the next night and for anyone who has flown internationally, as well as ever been to the San Francisco airport, knows it would be impossible for me to have made that flight (I was also already told prior to landing that they would not hold my flight to Sydney and there was nothing they could do except accommodate me). She then proceeded to tell me there was nothing she could do because the delay was due to the weather and not mechanics which sounds ridiculous to me. Not once did she ask me my name, my flight or anything. She was very inconsiderate and made me feel like this problem was my fault and it was not her's to deal with. She handed me a slip with an 800 number that I could call for a hotel. My main issues with the situation above were that from the start there were inconsistencies with their accommodations and what their employees are told. No one should have told me I would have been put up in a hotel if that was untrue. Second, was that this woman could not have cared less about a paying customer. American Airlines, you could not have put me up in a hotel for ~$100 when I paid over $1000 to fly with you?

I flew out with Japan airlines from Boston to Bangkok with a stop in Tokyo, then back to Tokyo after vacation 3 weeks later. They offered a comfortable aircraft for a long haul, beautiful and attentive staff, and good food. I then took these American Airlines flights. A new Boeing 787 - it was like going on a cross country trip in a subcompact car. I'm 6' tall 215 lbs, I'm a larger man but hardly a giant. The seats were hard and narrow. I had an aisle seat and every time the crew moved past me they hit my (recently surgically repaired) shoulder. I promise I wasn't sticking it out in the aisle. There was no one in the middle seat so my left leg got a break but my right knee (with the seat reclined, which is essential) was jammed into the armrest in front of me. This aircraft with these seats should not be flying 11 hour routes. Not to mention the tired, older staff (maybe they didn't see my shoulder?). Lousy food and service.

American Airlines,1,Donald Schon,30th January 2017,"Verified Review | I am basically aghast at the treatment we received. Travel is difficult for me because of multiple back surgeries so I purchase first-class tickets for long flights. This itinerary was Phoenix to Medellin return via Miami. On the segment from Miami to Medellin there are only two rows of first-class seats. In order to squeeze in another coach row, American put in a divider between first class and coach immediately behind the second row of first class seats. Thus, both on the segment from Miami to Medellin and Medellin to Miami our 1st class purchased seats would not and could not recline. The stewardesses basically begged us to write a letter to American about this. On the tarmac in Miami we heard rumblings about not enough room for the luggage. When we arrived in Medellin, our first class priority tag luggage was not on the plane. Nor was the luggage for at least 20% of the plane. There had not been room in the luggage hold, which I assume means they took on cargo in preference to passengers' luggage who were flying on that plane. Since there is only one flight a day American would not get our luggage to Medellin until 9:30 PM the following night. They would not deliver our luggage to us at night. Thus, in order to catch our internal connection at 5:30 AM the following morning we had to drive approximately one hour each way. We arrived at 9:30 PM and were kept waiting in the hall until 10:30 PM as they would not give us our luggage until all the passengers on the flight just landed had disembarked and claim their luggage. I contacted American Airlines. They never formally accepted responsibility nor took me seriously. The compensation they offered, I assume to get us off their back, was significantly less than you would offer a traveler who was bumped. This is in spite of the fact that we have been very frequent users of American Airlines and had their credit card for over 30 years. This was an amazing experience at alienating loyal customers.

American Airlines,1,V Arroyo Ornelas,30th January 2017,"Unverified | In carefully reviewing my options to return from Mexico City, I specifically chose a flight on American Airlines that would arrive in the evening at 7:07pm, even though the cost of the ticket was $30 more for two reasons: I didn't want to be in the airport at midnight and #2 I felt that this airline was a more reliable airline than the smaller less well-known airline options. On the day of my flight, January 26, 2016 I received a couple of e-mails letting me know that my flight had been delayed, first by approximately an hour and then by 1 1/2 hours. I was advised, however, to arrive at the normal time because the airline was doing everything possible so that the flight would depart at the regularly scheduled time of 4:40pm. When I arrived at the airport, no one was able to find my reservation and I realized that my flight had been cancelled altogether. I had to find an alternate flight. I ended up on an alternate flight with a different airline, arriving in LAX at 11:30pm, exactly what I had attempted to avoid. I ended up paying the higher price without the convenience of decent flying times. Next time I will go for a cheaper, smaller airline. At least if it is postponed or cancelled, I won't be paying the higher price for a benefit that I never receive. I was surprised and disappointed at this unexpected occurrence. I don't have a boarding pass to show for the airline I am reviewing because obviously I ultimately flew on a different airline.

American Airlines,1,S Simpson,28th January 2017,"Verified Review | I flew from London Heathrow to Chicago Illinois this January 2017. I was pregnant and very tired from the previous flight. My seat was right in the middle of middle row. I was experiencing very bad nausea and vomiting at that time so I asked one of flight attendant to change my seat to the side so I wouldn't have to bother the person sitting next to me to get up over and over again. There were 3 seats empty behind us. I asked her if I could sit there, it was closest to the bathroom too. She said no, even though those are empty seats, you're not allowed to sit there. So pretty much they'd rather leave those empty than give it to a pregnant woman. Nice job American. She told me once everyone was seated, she would find me a side seat closest to the bathroom. I said ok. So I waited and she came back and told me there are two seats available and were closest to the bathroom. I moved there and there was 1 person sitting at the other end. Luckily, he moved with his friend and I got 3 seats to myself. Being tired and fatigued, I pretty much slept throughout the whole flight. I missed the dinner. When I woke up, one of the flight attendant noticed that I was one of the passengers who hadn't eaten, however she did not care to ask if I wanted anything. I got a glass of water and went to sleep again. When I woke up, I went to the bathroom and when I came back I asked the flight attendant if I could have a food tray, she gave me a very rude look and left. She came back after 15 minutes with the tray. I will not recommend or fly with American Airlines again.

American Airlines,2,R Graham,23rd January 2017,"Verified Review | Kahului to Cleveland via Dallas Ft Worth. Terrible experience, stay away! My family and I had our flight home from Maui cancelled due to mechanical error/crew rest. This was only communicated to us after we were at the airport and were given several updates of the flight status. The American Airlines manager falsely secured hotel rooms at a local hotel that had no availability. He issued taxi vouchers to the hotel and when the taxi company found out that he was sending people to the hotel that had no vacancies, they communicated this to rest of the stranded passengers trying to find lodging. The manager would not even come down to baggage claim to address the situation with everyone who was trying to find lodging for the night. I was finally able to find lodging at a nearby Marriott and only due to my platinum status were they able to find me a room. My family and I finally arrived at our hotel at 2am and were exhausted and stressed out to no end. I was able to work with my travel agent and have American Airlines get us on a United flight the next day which was amazing. The American Airlines plane that we flew on from Dallas to Honolulu was very antiquated and did not have screens or USBs compared to the state of the art plane that we flew on with United to Chicago. Upon my return I was instructed to contact American Airlines customer service for reimbursement for our hotel, taxi, meals etc. Some of the AA customer service were very helpful, but the last representative would not allow me to speak with a supervisor or have a supervisor contact me to discuss complete reimbursement for my hotel. She told me that I would have to accept AA's contracted rate for a hotel regardless of my situation and stated that they offered my family $200 vouchers to use on a future AA flight. I told her that vouchers do not compensate me for expenses incurred by a hotel that I was required to secure due to their flight cancellation. All I can say is the cancellation is one thing, how they handled the cancellation is another story and the reimbursement for insult and injury is truly another chapter. Suffice to say for a difference of $300 which is what it would have required to compensate me completely, they have not only lost 4 customers, they have potentially lost many more after I share my experience.

My next flight was delayed for weather issues (which I know we can't control-gave an obvious pass here), but was then delayed for yet another mechanical problem (twice in one day AA-really?). Again, I was confined to the cabin for another 60+ minutes total. I have lost faith in both the quality and safety of their aircrafts if they are so prone to problems and in American Airlines ability to act in times of need.

American Airlines,7,G Berenyi,21st January 2017,"Verified Review | Myrtle Beach to Boston via Philadelphia. I was on vacation and found out I needed to head home to Canada ASAP just two days before intended departure (mind you, this was New Year's Eve). I looked all over the web looking for tickets with many different airlines and agencies and found nothing but economy tickets at prices typical of first class. American Airlines also were full of ridiculously overpriced last minute seats, that is except for one route through PHL and BOS which were almost fully booked and therefore was a dirt cheap ticket even compared to normal season tickets. I jumped on the opportunity and booked my tickets via PayPal, which made everything much faster and simpler. Upon getting to the airport I realized I needed to buy a tag for my duffle bag in order to get it checked... not the most enticing thing but it was a fast process through the machine and was taken care of within a matter of seconds. Upon boarding, I was not expecting much, granted, this flight was American Eagle and they are not exactly renowned for premium service. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort the seat had, and the flight attendants were in a good mood as well. Complimentary service on the flights were the same, a bag of pretzels and drinks, but who needs more than that on a flight that's 1.5 hrs long? I might also add that having my connecting gate exactly next to my arriving gate in PHL was a very rare and warm surprise. Gate attendants were friendly and cheerful, and seemed to be level with what they were doing. In summary, American is by no means a high-class airline to me, but I guess I was lucky in having been under the care of some really great people and it was well worth the low cost of the ticket. In the future, American will definitely be on my radar if I need a cheap last minute deal fast!",E170 / A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MYR to BOS via PHL,December 2016,4,4,3,1,4,5,yes
American Airlines,1,D Clark,18th January 2017,"Verified Review | I initially chose American Airlines because it was the cheapest flight available. I had never flown with American Airlines before, but I expected the experience to at least be on par with United Airlines. However, I was quickly turned off by this airline upon entering the aircraft. All of the flight attendants were beyond rude. They were basically yelling at passengers to sit down, and they were condescending about the most routine of things. Besides the horrendous attendants, the plane was so crammed. You can tell that they are trying to cram as many people on the plane as possible with no care for passenger's space or comfort. I had just flown on a Japan Airlines domestic flight, and the American Airline flight cannot compare to the space and comfort of that domestic flight. The only good that came from using American Airlines is that I now know that Japan Airlines will be my go-to carrier from now on.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,NRT to DFW,January 2017,1,1,1,2,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,Jee Eun Kim,15th January 2017,"Verified Review | My trip from Seoul, South Korea to St.Louis, Missouri took a total of 41+ hours. It's usually, at maximum, a 16 hour deal. The ETA for my original itinerary was at the latest 8:30pm Friday night CST. Currently, I'm writing this review with rage at Dallas Fort Worth Airport on Sunday 1:10AM, approx 29 hours later than the initial ETA. And for now, IF all goes well, my final ETA would be Sunday 1pm. That would be 41 hours after the initial ETA. I do understand when it comes to weather issues; in fact, I am grateful that they weren't hesitant to make customer safety first. But the first 24 hour delay of my itinerary was purely the airline's lack of thorough preparation beforehand. Everyone had already boarded on the plane, and halfway into the runway, the plane decided to turn back and redo a checkup. From which they decided to cancel the flight for the night and try again 23 hours later. How was it that they detected the problem only right before we were about to set off? And when I was struck with the news after having finally arrived in Dallas that my connecting flight to the final destination got canceled, they were little to not at all sympathetic.

After repeatedly delaying, then cancelling my flight over a five hour period during which I sat at the airport and watched others placed on flights, American was unable to even find a flight to Dallas on their airline. Instead I was told that I had to drive to another airport at my own expense, board a plane on a different airline to get to Oklahoma City, and once in Oklahoma City, pay for a rental car at my own expense so I could drive another hour in below zero Fahrenheit conditions to reach Stillwater, OK. I had specifically bought a ticket from Houston to Stillwater to avoid driving and spent nearly $200 on the rental car. And it took me nearly 12 hours from my arrival at the airport to reach my destination.

Upon arriving at DFW for the return flight, the status of the flight on the American Airlines official website was listed as ""On Time"". Upon checking in at airport, I was moved to economy class and told I would be reimbursed. Attendant at counter told me the flight was late from Miami (original destination) enroute to DFW. I pleaded unsuccessfully with assigned seat. Inside the cabin, the seats were in a two-three-two configuration. I noticed the seats were old and deteriorated. The TV/Entertainment did not work. My overhead light did not work either! Can you imagine? A thirteen hour scheduled flight! Tried to use my iPad but was not able to watch movies either. I read my book, listened to music with my I-Pad. Due to fight being completely full, it was hard to sleep. The food was terrible compared to the flight from Japan to the US. Yes, I was reimbursed, however, I wonder what was the point in pre-paying for premium economy 4 weeks ahead and then ending up with what I was trying to prevent in the first place? Very disappointed.

I have experienced more delayed and cancelled flights in the last 14 months than I have in the previous 10 years.

American Airlines,10,M Irving,12th January 2017,"Verified Review | First time I have flown with American Airlines as I usually fly United to the US. Flew from London Heathrow to Chicago ORD. Fare was on offer so I flew American Business class to the US and British Airways First Class back to the UK. Checking in - Heathrow airport I arrived at 05.30, the check in desks did not open until 06.00 for an 08.40 flight. I was aware of the desk opening times so waiting was not a problem. There was a dedicated check in desk for business passengers and when I arrived there was only one other couple in front of me. Check in quick and efficient. No problems encountered. As I was flying business class I was informed that I could use the fast track security lane and make use of the American Airlines lounge. Boarding as with all major airlines boarding was the usual, Family's with children, Passengers that require help / more time followed by business class. On boarding I was direct to my seat and once seated asked if I would like a drink, went for Champagne (very nice too). Flight attendants very attentive, refilling my glass when it became empty. Inflight entertainment, for business class passengers on the 767 you are given a Samsung tablet and Bose headphones. Great choice of films & TV on the tablet only minor niggle is that the tablet is taken back about an hour before landing so a bit annoying if you are halfway through a decent film, also I am not sure how passengers who do not use tablets would of managed. Seat - I found the seat comfortable enough, plenty of leg room. As this was a morning flight I did not feel the need to make use of the lie flat feature so I cannot comment. The seat is controlled via a touch panel and it seems a bit sensitive as while resting my arm on the side the seat started to change position, I did this a couple of times until I placed something over the panel to prevent me from altering my seat layout accidently. I was seated in 4A a window seat. Landing luggage was through fairly quickly again no issues were encountered.

American Airlines,1,J Wickham,12th January 2017,"Verified Review | I had a flight Miami to London Heathrow via Boston. The check in was an unnecessarily stressful and upsetting experience caused by the unprofessionalism and aggression of American Airlines ground staff. After 30 minutes waiting in line the ground crew member informed those of us waiting there that the five desk staff were finishing their shift and we had to leave the line. Despite protests from my fellow passengers the woman informed us the staff would “up and leave” when their shift was finished. I am sympathetic that their shift was over but surely it would have been more effective to allow those of us waiting to check in or be served by other desk staff. I have never seen staff upping and leaving when there is a long line of people waiting without making sure they were to be attended to. I was then instructed to join the general enquiry line. In this line were people who had missed connections, missed flights, rebooking flights, unable to check in manually, oversized baggage, etc. The staff appeared to be directing people to lines in order to be rid of them and did not allow questions to be finished nor addressing passengers’ issues. Just a simple “go stand in that line”. The complaints from my fellow passengers echoed my own disbelief that at one point less than five desk staff were there to serve the long line of people and there was no coordination of passengers who had little time until boarding. I tried in vain to ask if another check-in option was available - highlighting my fear I would miss my connecting flight to London if I missed the domestic flight - but was continually dismissed. After two hours of waiting I was finally able to check in my luggage and thanks to the security staff allowing me to fast track through security I made the flight.

My trip to and fro were full of issues. I chose a morning flight at 7am since the ticket was cheaper, and and got to SFO at 5am, while thinking that I was giving myself ample time before departure. I was badly mistaken. When I got there, I saw a long line of more than 40 people queuing. The American Airlines check-in staff were rude and unsympathetically telling people in the queue who have missed their 6am flight that there's nothing they can't do about it, although the problems were due to their slow service. When checking in using the self check-in kiosk, I had problems scanning my passport, the kiosk asked me to verify my travel documents despite my having an Indonesian passport and traveling to Indonesia, and it ran out of paper to print my luggage tags. Many of the check-in kiosks were unresponsive and no one was there to fix it. IFE was the only decent thing they had, their screens are surprisingly capacitive, which allows much better interaction with your fingers. Inflight cabin attendants were impolite. My return flight wasn't a better experience. Upon arriving at LAX after a 7-hour and 9-hour flight, I was told that my LAX to SFO flight was canceled and of course there's nothing American Airlines can do about it besides rebooking my flight to the next day (which they can't even do automatically), and I didn't like that since I have to get back to work the next day. I had to drive back from LA to SF after my 20 hour trip, while jet-lagged. Seriously, avoid American Airlines like the plague.

When we went to the Amercian Airlines ticket counter on January 6 to get our boarding passes for return flight from College Station on Amerian Airline Flight 2803 leaving at 10:35 AM, the American Airline Agent told us that our return tickets were cancelled by Orbitz perhaps by error and hence she would be unable to give us boarding passes. It was a real surprise to us! The plane was about to leave in less than an hour. I frantically called Orbitz and they expressed apology and tried to fix the problem. The first agent at Orbitz could not solve the problem and then passed the call to his supervisors and after being on the phone for more than two hours, Orbitz finally was able to reinstated our tickets in American Airline System. By the time our scheduled flight left the airport and our connecting flight from Dallas to Richmond got sold out. Orbitz suggested that we buy two new one way tickets for later flight and they would reimburse us. There was no guarantee that we will ever get reimbursed based on verbal commitment by Orbitz. So we got quite concerned. We went back to the AA agent and she understood our dilemma, she watched us talking to Orbitz for two hours to resolve the issue. She went back on her own and talked to her supervisor while I was on the phone with Orbitz. She came back to tell us that she would try to switch our reinstated tickets to a later flight from CLL to RIC via DFW.

American Airlines,1,Niccole Liriano,6th January 2017,"Verified Review | Flying with American Airlines from Miami to La Guardia, New York has been the most frustrating and disappointing experience I have ever had traveling. The staff are rude and uneducated and they have many staff members who only speak one language (which makes it really difficult to communicate). I arrived late to my flight in Miami because I was on a previous flight that we missed due to bad weather. When I get to Miami I had about an hour to get everything done but with the lack of education and common sense from the staff members at American Airlines I was cut short on time. First off in my previous flight I was given a standby ticket for this flight because we were not going to make it to our original flight. When I get to Miami and tried explaining that to the staff member in bag check in she told me ""keep your mouth shut and give me your ticket"". She then tells me I'm too late to check in my bags so I decide not to go with bags. The women gave me back my stand by ticket instead of boarding pass which did not allow me to go to TSA. I then had to go back in the line to get a boarding pass. Finally got a boarding pass and TSA were excellent and let us go ahead of everyone so we could make the flight. When I get to the gate the ""manager"" told me I was not able to get on board because the doors were closed. It was 8.20 and the flight got delayed to 8.40. If I'm not mistaken you can board up to 10 minutes prior to flying. She refused to let us on and decided that her best customer service skill was to scream at us.

American Airlines,1,Paul Renshaw,6th January 2017,"Verified Review | I bought my ticket via British Airways and 2 of the 5 sectors were with American Airlines. I had thought since I'd bought a full service ticket all the flights would be with full service airlines and not mixed with a budget airline. I am writing to BA to complain - even though the 3 sectors flying with BA were wonderful. My first flight with AA was Las Vegas to London via Chicago. I had no money on me and my cards were in my hand luggage as I didn't think they were needed. These were put in the hold anyway as there was no space in the lockers, but I did not know AA was a budget airline and the whole ""money, money, money is everything"". I got a ""free"" glass of water and went hungry. I then had a tight connection at ORD so had to get straight to the next gate (it said free soft drink is back with much fanfare, so yes, they must have tried to remove even that). I was pleased to see a new aircraft, but it ended there. The staff were such a mixed bunch, never seen a flight crew like it, it was almost as if they were volunteers. Anyway, they were nice enough, a million miles from a full service airline but reckon they gave all they could with their working conditions. Anyway my whole reason for writing this review is because of the food. Now I could feel the resentment from American Airlines. How dare they have to give free food out. What a shame so much of the transatlantic competitors do. I say free, of course it's in the ticket price but they call it complimentary. So by this point I'm starving and my kosher meal came. It blew my mind. One stale bun, crumbled in my hands. No butter or even spread, you'll have it dry. A side of sour shredded veg. I don't know, it was like coleslaw with no mayo and sat in vinegar for days on end until it wilted. Must have been the cheapest thing the catering firm had, it was beyond vile. Simply not edible. The teeny ""main"" was beyond it as well, little drops of pasta that were so overcooked it liquefied upon contact with tongue and tasted of nothing. Just unbelievable. The BBQ ""chicken"" was highly processed, bland and a perfect partner for the horror of it all. Maybe 5,000 flights, this was the most pathetic assortment of rubbish I'd ever been given. Then there was a tiny square of sponge with jam and coconut. I can't eat coconut but hey, the whole thing was vile. For ""breakfast"" the offering was so ridiculous I kindly asked the attendant to take it back. I had hoped for a full English, but thought I might get a warmed 7 day croissant, but no, it was a stale bun with no butter. The mainstream offering was a bag of dried cranberries which I can't eat, a mixed berry slice of muffin (don't expect a full muffin!). It doesn't sound so horrific, just cheap, but I can't eat dried fruit. I did eat the yogurt which American couldn't mess up. I left the first plane ravenous and the second chewing my knuckles. There were only two drinks served over the 7 hours of course. Paid a full service price and fobbed me off with this.

American Airlines,1,G Mears,5th January 2017,"Verified Review | Tampa to San Francisco via Phoenix. Hands down the worst airline experience I have ever had. Almost every agent, flight attendant, and other airline staff were inefficient, disgruntled, or rude. I would never recommend this airline. On flight out we had a super old plane that was making all kinds of weird/loud noises. We were on the same plane out of Phoenix and they wouldn't take off with the noise so we returned to the gate and sat for over an hour and a half with no information on what was wrong (just the repeated ""technical issue"" update at about 15 mins intervals and no cabin service). The plane was completely powered off at one point which meant no lights/air for a period of time. When we finally made it to Tampa the power also went off as we were trying to de-board. Fast forward to the return flight and after waiting in a super long line, the curbside check-in didn't work and they wouldn't tell us why. Had to wait in another line to check our stroller inside and the agent there was convinced we were traveling to San Francisco, Costa Rica, not CA. Printed off boarding passes for Tampa and Phoenix in a horrible jumble which we were forced to sort ourselves at security with (at this point) screaming children in tow. Barely made the flight and we were at the airport almost 2 hours in advance. In Phoenix we discovered for some reason our boarding passes no longer had priority on them but group two. I had to wait at the counter for at least 15 mins (children now screaming again) while the agent completely ignored me, and when I was finally able to ask if we could board with priority as we had on every other leg I was very rudely interrupted as the agent said repeatedly, ""what's written on your boarding pass, what's written on your boarding pass?"" We were in the back of the plane that leg - with a four-year old and two-year old. Boarding in group 2 was an absolute nightmare and we held up a bunch of other people. We are also (or I should say were as of today) platinum card holders, but because my father booked the trip for us that didn't matter. At least the plane was newer on that leg, but super bare-bones for the age. Couldn't get the in-flight streaming option to work either (they only support for a limited number of browsers).

The entire plane was extremely upset on the poor choice and way of communication, with no regards for the huge investment on our vacation. Upon arrival back in Miami the entire plane, about several 100 people weren't assisted in any way by AA. After waiting almost an hour, they advised us to head to gate D37 a rebooking center, a nightmare of several hours that did not help. We ended up on a flight out of Miami to Charllotte that evening to head into Denver the next morning. We lost that night stay at our hotel in Vail, our lift ticket the following day and ski rental.

The inflight service was terrible; bad food, small servings, irresponsive crews, overcrowded lavatories, smaller aisle. This was all bearable until I reached Los Angeles for my 14 hours layover for my flight to Mexico city. The flight was suppose to depart at 23:55 at first, then delays of 20, 50, 120 minutes was announced until the flight was announced cancelled. Along with 6 other flights in LAX, American Airlines cancelled these flights altogether creating a mayhem in LAX. The airline has a customer service counter with 2 desks, just 2! And any other AA personnel you see in the airport are unwilling to answer any questions and they try to direct you to the service counter. When 7 flights are cancelled at one time, the queues to the counter are long, I mean 7-Hours long in the end. After getting reneged on your contract with AA to fly to your destination, you are forced to wait 7-hours to get an answer. So I did exactly that, and only then I knew it was because they had poor crew scheduling, resulting in insufficient crews to provide those flights. How is that even possible? With poor regulations of airline policies in the US, these airlines and airports are falling way behind with competitions from Middle East and Asia. So at the counter, I asked what do you have for me? The nonchalant service crew wasn't unsympathetic about our situation and just offered a replacement flight 3-days later - 3 days, 72-hours and told me there is nothing else they can do about it. Since I have my activities booked in Mexico city already, i have to pay a last-minute ticket to the city on my own which cost me $600 USD. American Airlines are unwilling to do anything about it and just asked me to collect my ""checked"" luggage which is left somewhere in the airport, without anyone overseeing it. To be honest, I read reviews about AA before buying the flight but did not know it can be this terrible.

American Airlines,1,Robert Mcshane,29th December 2016,Verified Review | Orlando to Los Angeles. Utterly disappointed in American Airlines service. First the website told us all seats were taken except additional cost seats at $90. They made us check in at airport and stand in a long line of surly employees to be told that there were actually many available seats at no additional cost. Duplicitous and inconvenient. Next we were told no overheard space for carry ons was left and had to check our carry ons and pick them up at baggage claim. Also ridiculous. AA knows exactly how many people and bags they have - they only run out of space by letting people fill overhead bins with jackets etc. Irresponsible. I would try hard never to fly with these unhappy employees nor this third rate airline. On a humanistic note: there was a Spanish speaking woman in line next to us who was repeatedly dismissed and sent to the back of the line because no one would bother to call one of the many bilingual employees to assist her.

American Airlines,1,M Livingston,28th December 2016,"Verified Review | Miami to Philadelphia. Horrible customer service. After already checking in and going through security, I switched to an earlier flight and was assured by a really nice guy on phone that my bag could be transferred, all I needed to do was speak to an agent here at the airport. Only problem is there wasn't a single agent at any of the desks, including customer service. I finally found an agent behind the Cuba desk and she told me I couldn't switch baggage in domestic flights. So I booked a reservation, paid a fee under the impression by baggage could arrive with me because of contradictory beliefs on a basic, fundamental policy, which should have been explained before I booked my new flight. I called customer service and they said they would not refund me the baggage fee for the inconvenience of coming back to the airport at 1AM to pick up my luggage. She told me to find a different agent and see what could be done. When I found another agent she was on the phone speaking to a friend in Spanish and popping her gum, ignored me for three minutes, then told me to have a seat and be patient for the agent who will arrive in 30 minutes.

Mind you, my father is not the most patient man the earth has ever seen. It took them more than 24 hours to get from Southern Nebraska to San Antonio. That's ridiculous. First, their plane was late arriving at the airport so they could get on it in the first place. Then their flight from DFW to SAT was cancelled, but the airline staff did not announce that, instead they kept leading everyone on as if the plane would be ready at any minute. Their plane, finally ""ready"" at 0700 the next morning, was fully loaded and ready for take off. Until the crew discovered the brakes weren't working. Back to the gate and off the plane they go.

There is far more room in the seat for storage and shelf space as well as small pockets to stow a mobile whilst charging. The seat is far more private and the kit bag is much better too.

This has happened 3 times in the last month on AA - gate agents who insist on taking your bag ""saying there is no more room in the overhead"".

Of couse when I got on the plane, there was still room in the overhead and room underneath my ""economy plus"" seat. I wouldn't care if it was a short flight but AA is consistently late and in the last month I had to spend the night in Miami due to their late takeoff and arrival, and they had checked my carry at the gate, to my final destination (Las Vegas) using their same lame excuse.

This is not my worst experience with flying but still, it's the fact of the matter. If I showed up late to my flight, canceled, or had to switch, American Airlines would charge me for that mistake.

American Airlines,1,Sarah Hakola,18th December 2016,"New York JFK to Akron–Canton via Charlotte. Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no. I finally made it home after many hours, many tears, and lots of frustration.

American Airlines,2,Sarah Chaikind,18th December 2016,"Baltimore to Miami with American Airlines. This was one of the worst flight experiences I had ever had. Our flight was meant to leave at 530 am and due to icy weather conditions, we were delayed 6 hours. Although the staff were kind, we ended up waiting on the aircraft for hours with little to no information. When we finally took off, about an hour into the flight the pilot informed us that due to a mechanical malfunction we would have to make an emergency landing in Jacksonville (intended destination = Miami.) Again captain and crew were great - no complaints. Once we landed, we were told very little about the prognosis of our aircraft and we ended up having to wait in a huge group of 160 people as we learned very slowly that the flight could not be officially cancelled until they were certain they couldn't find a replacement captain and crew, but also couldn't help us rebook a new flight to make connections. Thus, this all resulted in zero contingency plan and lots of unnecessary waiting. When we finally departed for Miami at 1030 pm on the original aircraft with a new captain and crew, we were promised hotel and transportation vouchers upon our arrival in MIA. However when we arrived, the line to receive these vouchers was hundreds of people long with no end in sight.

As every year I flew to Miami after attending a medical congress in Chicago so used my AAdvantage points to book a free flight to Florida on November 30th. As I am aware some American Airlines planes are very old I usually try to book a flight operated by some newish Boeing 737-800 which are very common on this route: this year I wanted to fly business class (they call it First but it's just a trick) so I had limited options for ny reward ticket and I ended up in a 4:40pm flight. They changed the plane to a B757 a few weeks after my booking so in the end my flight was operated by a glorious aircraft from the '80s with extremely wide but hard seats with limited recline capability. Because of a technical issue, departure was delayed for about one hour (this happened in about 40% of all the flights I had with AA so far, kind of disturbing if you compare with other major airlines) but no big deal as I was not in a hurry. No PTV on the seat just the old fashioned hanging monitor with terrible sound and video quality, so bad they even had to interrupt the safety video because it was a torture for our ears. Flight was uneventful with a pleasant purser who greeted passengers one by one by shaking their hands both upon boarding and before landing. I did not feel like eating so did not try the meal which did look fine by the way (chicken with some vegetables).

American Airlines,9,Alan Wan,13th December 2016,"Verified Review | I was flying MIA to LHR via JFK with American Airlines. This review is for the MIA-JFK route. I was originally booked onto a 757, international configuration with angled lie flat seats. However I took the opportunity to do a same day flight change and get an earlier flight, this would enable me to do a quick bit of shopping. Additionally the change of flight allowed me to sample a reconfigured 767, with the lie flat seats. I arrived at MIA at 6.45am for my 9.26am departure. There was no queue for the Priority check-in and I just needed to pick up my boarding passes as I was hand bag only. The check-in associate was friendly and helpful. I had access to fast track security and I was through in 5 minutes. I used the Admirals Club at Gate 30. It was a pretty pathetic offering, unlike the AA First class lounge at JFK which is excellent. The AC had a very limited free breakfast offering and I had a bagel and coffee. I was provided with a single drinks voucher which I used to get a bottle of water for the flight. Boarding commenced on time at precisely 8.56am - 30 minutes before departure. After people with access needs boarded, First class passengers were invited to board. On boarding a FA offered to hang my coat and I was offered a pre departure drink and I selected coffee. On international legs, a Samsung tablet is provided, but only main screen entertainment was offered on this short 2.5 hour flight. I was provided with in ear headphones. The seat was excellent, fully flat with plenty of space. I was seated in 6D, I would have preferred a window but none where available at checkin. I would have been happy with this seat on an international sector, so felt spoilt for a short domestic flight. The FA who looked after me was great, friendly, attentive and address me by my name. Cereal or a three cheese omelette were on offer. I chose the latter which was definitely the most popular choice. The omelette and the sausage provided were not great, but the side veggies and biscuit were excellent. After eating I promptly fell asleep for the remainder of the flight.

The service on the return flight from JFK to Tucson in Economy Preferred seating was non existent. Monday 8:00 PM departure on November 22nd from JFK to Tucson, immediate announcement from the cockpit that we could expect air turbulence and the seat belt sign would remain on the entire flight. We encountered three or four slight bumps mid flight, that was it totally smooth flying. Since the seat belt sign was pre determined to stay on it gave the entire plane, except first class no cabin service on the five plus hour flight. The other major uncomfortable problem was the cabin temperature was around 80 degrees and yet there was no one to ask about getting air turned down. No one approached any of the passengers on this five plus hour flight. I arrived Tucson soaked with sweat and dehydrated from no fluid. The first thing I did the next day was cancel the future flights I had booked on American. I realize the airline is working hard to make a comeback, they still have a lot of problems and created a very unpleasant flight back from a long weekend in NYC.

Had several problems whilst upgrading a seat, I got triple charged, AA took a lifetime to credit my account again. As compensation they gave a $25 reward voucher, (I spent over £40 in telephone calls to their ridiculous call centre to get them to sort out this issue). Inflight staff and staff in both airports were extremely rude and snobby, always looking down on you. Generally quite unprofessional. The staff on our flight told us not to call a flight attendant for beverages, instead we were supposed to go to the back of the plane and request them (unheard of on a long haul) .I told them this was ridiculous and that I would do no such thing as that would involve waking up a fellow passenger sleeping next to us on a aisle seat. We were delayed by 2 hours due to a technical issue and there was no update from the captain on whether or not we would make up the time. Check in and airport staff in JFK need to learn some customer service skills. No smiling, rude people that generally look fed up in life and with their job. They sigh, they roll their eyes. Quite possibly the rudest staff I have ever dealt with. (I fly a lot with many airlines).

Bumped from first class to a middle seat in economy with minimal compensation ($300 future flight credit) and no explanation or apology or even an understanding of why we were irritated.

We were also never told how it was decided which of the first class passengers were bumped. When I asked I was ignored. There were about 12 passengers bumped and put in row 30 or higher in economy, half in middle seats. Horrible handling by AA staff.

When it goes wrong is where they differentiate themselves; American Airlines so often can't seem to handle a situation professionally and positively. Flew Chicago to Paris via Dallas Ft Worth in 1st/Business Class. The morning of the flight I checked and at 7am, and my 1pm flight was already showing it would be delayed. Amazing that 6 hours before my flight and before the plane has left its initial city that it was delayed. I called American Airlines and they changed me to the 11:45am flight to DFW - all good. Flight left on time - sat in the AAdmirals lounge for a couple hours and made my way to the gate for the Paris flight (AA 48). Boarding time was close and then all of a sudden we see the entire crew come off the plane. 20 min past boarding time they announce that there is a mechanical issue and there is a plane 2 gates down we can take. Great. We get there and wait for 2 hours - being told its taking that much time to move our catering and luggage over from one plane to the other - just a few gates away. After 90 minutes they brought chips and drinks which was nice. And they were re-routing people with connections as in the end it was over a 2+ hour delay on arriving into Paris. The inflight service was excellent - they were apologetic about the delay and the FA serving my aisle was funny and considerate. But again - nothing from American Airlines once I landed. With Delta - you have such a delay you check your email and you have an apology and 10,000 points in your account. Proactive - great policy. American? Nothing. No email. No offer. Just deal with it. So I complained online and they sent me 7,500 miles and an apology. I appreciate it but it also doesn't make up for the Euro 166 I had to pay for my new train ticket from Paris to Amsterdam that I missed due to the flight delay.

We sat on the tarmac for 3 hours with only 2 updates the entire time before they cancelled the flight due to mechanical issues. We were never once offered a beverage and the planes air conditioning had to be turned off so it was sweltering in the cabin with every seat occupied. Once we exited the aircraft, it was sheer chaos in attempting to figure out our next move and we were told we were not allowed to leave the airport. After waiting in the airport for another 2 hours with small children, we were finally given a voucher to a cheap hotel. Our family's flights were all completely different when they were finally rescheduled. I had to pay $100 to be able to stay in our room until 6 PM and our new flight did not even leave until midnight. Our new flight was late getting in into Phoenix and then delayed another 2 hours before we could leave for Chicago. When I questioned how we would make our connecting flight in Chicago, the AA staff was rude and snapped ""Well, I guess you won't now, will you?"" We missed our connecting flight and had to wait another 4 hours in Chicago. When I tried to speak with someone in customer service, I was told repeatedly that I had to go to the website and file a complaint.

I wish I could say that ""I will never fly on American Airlines again"" like some reviewers, but the truth is, with mergers and consolidation it is difficult to do this. This was a trip to Peru, with the flights split between American and LATAM airlines. Three legs of the trip were on American and three on LATAM. The comparison was not good for American. First of all, of the three legs, two of the planes had mechanical issues which led in one case to have to switch planes and the other to sit on the tarmac for an hour. The longest flight was from Miami to Lima on a 767. It looked and felt old and worn out. The seats were pure punishment. They were not the new ""slim line"" seats, but were worn to the point of being hard. The legroom was poor, and I'm only 5'6"". I can't imaging what a six foot tall person had to endure. There was no in seat entertainment, just the drop down screens in various locations. We had a chance to alter our trip plans, and it would have been convenient to change our return trip to leave from Cusco instead of Juliaca. All other legs of the trip would be the same. American could do it for an increase of $7,500! They said the flights were full, and we would have to fly business class. We pointed out that we were holding economy class seats on two flights, so they couldn't be sold out. The response was, ""That's our policy.""

Then we were told that we have to ask for the refund from AA (e.g. lets not make it simple for the customer, lets make it harder for them). Well I just got my refund and guess what, it is only $98.35 each. Does that make up the difference in first class and coach? They have no way to challenge a refund or even to talk to someone.

But after turning around and returning to the gate to stand in line for 7 hours one gets a little a testy. After standing in said line we were given no information about when we would be on another flight and another hour later were shuttled to a hotel where we still received no info. I had to call the airline myself, from a foreign county to find out how I was going to make it home. After being given the wrong information and seeing that our online itinerary had us going to the wrong final destination I had to call again. We finally made it home about 30 hours later. We were in good spirits as was most of the flight despite our trouble. However after several hours of no organization or communication and being left to fend for ourselves on how to get home we were all pretty livid. I wouldn't normally go out of my way to share a negative experience but this was so grossly mishandled that I thought others should know.

American Airlines,1,E Young,10th November 2016,"Verified Review | Dallas Ft Worth to Paris CDG, connecting to El Al for flight to Tel Aviv. After checking in approximately 3.5 hours prior to departure, which is ample time for international travel, and my bag being tagged as ""Priority,"" since Monday, November 7, no one can tell me with certainty where my luggage is. In CDG I was told that I needed to give the gate agents the code for my padlocks even though they are TSA approved. I complied with their request and gave them my code. Prior to arrival in Tel Aviv, I was advised by the flight attendant that my bag had not made it on the flight and to ensure that I would file a claim with El Al at the Lost Baggage counter prior to exiting the TLV airport, which I did. The agent there told me that there were two flights coming in later, and that my case would be on one of them. They gave me a bag with very basic toiletries and what looked like a short pyjama suited for my 10 year-old granddaughter. They told me that there was no allowance until after 24 hours. I was also asked to cross off from my declaration any items over $100 so I wouldn't need to return to the airport to pay duty on those items. I questioned the accuracy of her statement, but the agent who filed my claim with El Al insisted that I had to cross off on my form what I had begun to list as items over $100 in value, which I did. That was Tuesday, November 8. On Wednesday, November 9, the hotel concierge followed up on my claim. The person he spoke with said for me to get whatever I needed and to keep all receipts. That evening the concierge followed up with El Al again, who informed us that my luggage was still in Dallas! I called back and spoke with Maya, who told me American Airlines had put my luggage on a flight to Toronto and then it was scheduled to get onto an Air Canada flight to Tel Aviv. ETA was now for Thursday morning. I am joining a Holy Land tour and had gone a few days ahead to spend visiting Jerusalem. Instead, I have been wasting my time trying to track my luggage. A hotel guest relayed to the concierge and me that El Al had told her that if she wanted her luggage the day it had arrived, she would have to get a taxi to and fro the airport as their courier was no longer available, which she had no other choice but to do it. Armed with this information I hung tight by the hotel. On Thursday morning (I departed on Monday), the El Al call center for lost luggage would not put me through a manager as he was calling American Airlines liars. He said he would have a manager call me, which still has not happened. As of Thursday afternoon, American told my husband that they lost track of my luggage in Toronto and that they could not access El Al lost baggage system. El Al claims AA is lying as the lost luggage system is an international system, not El Al's. Until they physically have my case in their possession, El Al cannot do or say anything further. And besides being tagged ""Priority,"" they also have me as VIP in their system. I have lost the extra days in Israel. What promised to be a trip of a lifetime has become a nightmare for me.

American Airlines,9,B Stewart,9th November 2016,"Verified Review | I've had my share of bad experiences with American Airlines including permanently lost luggage, misconnects, delays and rude customer service on the ground and in the air. I’ve tended to avoid them except for domestic US travel so approached this HKG-LAX flight with trepidation. The key attraction was a business class fare significantly lower than any other direct service on the route (and even cheaper than one-stops via Seoul or Taipei). Perhaps I was very impressed because my expectations were set so low. This was a very good flight. Same J class seat as CX, except AA provided a mattress and pyjamas. They served plated food of decent quality and quantity, had a decent wine list and a provided a wide selection of programming on the IFE so delivered on everything you should expect from a world class premium airline. Ultimately what made this flight very good was the crew. They appeared to be enjoying their jobs – lots of smiles and proactive interaction with the passengers. I could not fault any aspect of the service. I’m now willing to consider American Airlines for long haul business class travel if this is the level of service they can deliver consistently.

I went to baggage claim (out of secure area), waited for my bag, didn't find it, then was told it was being automatically transferred. I had to go back, through security.

American Airlines,1,J Horne,5th November 2016,"Verified Review | Dallas to Birmingham, AL. I performed a same day reservation change to a later flight in the day. I was charged $75 for the change. I tried to check in online 90 minutes prior to departure three times with no success. I called customer service and asked them for assistance and they said you can only check in online and at the airport. I arrived to the ticket counter 30 minutes prior to my flight and she said this is odd, I can see you are on this flight but there are no seats. I asked how that could be. She even called a coworker over and they said all we can do is put you on standby for the next flight. I was pretty upset and proceeded through security to the gate arriving 15 minutes prior to departure time. I asked the girl at the gate counter why my seat was given away and she called a gentleman over and they whispered as they looked on the screen. She asked him if she should pull ""her"" from the plane. She then closed the door and locked it. He stood there as if I should just walk off gingerly. I debated with him about why their antics were bad business and his only come back was that I should have checked in earlier. I said like 90 minutes earlier like I tried to do. Not everyone can be at the gate 2 hours prior to a flight. This is 2016 - that's what technology is for which American Airlines is obviously struggling with. Not to mention customer service. I called customer service again, this time speaking to an agent who was nice but obviously thought her level of kindness was equaled by my ignorance. She put me on hold for a few minutes after hearing my story and has the audacity to come back and say I got you on the 8:15 flight. I asked the flight I'm already on after getting dumped on by your company? She said it's the least I can do. I said what about a refund or a voucher or waiving the $75 I had to pay for a flight you gave my seat away on which had I known was going to happen would have never changed to? She said I'm afraid I can't do anything sir. This is all comical now but being a business guy I can see huge inefficiencies in operations and customer service. So in all honesty I would not fly American Airlines. I know I won't.

No sooner were we taxiing back to the gate without an explanation until 20 minutes later when we were told about electronic problem. On our flight which lasted over 7-hours we received a bag of stale mini pretzels. As we approached Phoenix airport we circled for 30 minutes without any updates from the captain. We then began to pick up speed and told we were headed to Palm Springs because there was not enough fuel to continue circling. We finally land at our diversion site in Palm Springs where we proceed to sit on the runway for an hour because there are no AA agents to assist us at a gate. Not once are we offered beverage or snack. After over an hour we finally depart back to Phoenix with again no regular updates from cockpit.

Good safety demonstration video, and a smooth, on-time flight with good information from the crew. My bags needed to be re-checked at Cathay Pacific due to their flight being the following day, but LAX staff took a while to send them to the carousel. The only things I missed in-flight were a foot/leg rest in the seat, and the lack of a GIS flight map on the TV monitors. Overall, I was very satisfied with this flight.

Rather, we were told that we just didn't have a seat assignment yet and would get one as soon as we checked in at the gate. Once we checked at gate they kept telling us that we would be called up soon, again no mention of flight being overbooked. It was only after they had boarded the plane and I asked agent directly three times if we had a seat on the plane that she said ""doesn't look good"". She then finally admitted that the flight was overbooked. Per their stated overbooking policy, they are supposed to ask for volunteers which never happened. In this case the agents also seemed incompetent at counting because after we continued to complain she went on the plane to look and ""found"" 2 open seats. She then followed behind us screaming ""Run! Run!"" as we walked to board the plane.

Instead of putting the dog in its carrier, the woman petted the dog, and passed it back and forth to another passenger across the isle several times during the 5+ hour flight. One of the flight attendants even carried the dog up to the front of the plane so that the other attendants could pet it. The dog was not a service dog. I have severe allergies, I and several other passengers nearby began coughing and sneezing. When I mentioned to FA's that this was against AA's pet policy, they claimed to be unfamiliar with the policy. I have been on many, many flights with dogs and cats, and never once complained. With the exception of service dogs, which laid quietly on the floor, all other pets remained in their cases under the seat. I took allergy medicine and was able to manage my symptoms. This is the only flight I have ever been on where a pet has been allowed to be loose and to be handled in such a way. I contacted Customer Relations, expecting to have them apologize, and received a meaningless, copy-and-paste response. The response does not indicate in any way that they understand the issue, recognize that their own policies were not followed, or have any intention of addressing the situation in any way.

American Airlines,1,Emily Smaridge,25th October 2016,"Tampa to Grenada via Miami. Traveling on American Airlines is terrible. They have an app that allows you to check-in before you get to the airport. We did this, but when we went to drop off our bags, they sent us to one of about 30 kiosks with poorly written software that wasted 20 minutes of our time just to print out a bag tag. You then have to walk up to a clerk who then weighs your bag, checks your ticket and ID all over again. Why do we have to do the same exact thing twice? Total waste of time. Once we were on the plane, we were excited to see that there were TVs with movies, tv shows, etc available. However, the pilot and attendants interrupt the screens whenever they speak over the microphone, and they play through your headphones at inexcusable volume. Each time they came over the loudspeaker, you could look around and everyone was ripping their earphones out of their ears. This was at least twice an hour on a 3 hour flight. On the 3 hour flight, you can have 1 drink but no snacks are provided. I know that flying isn't luxurious in economy class, but they make everything more annoying and complicated than needed.

Hopefully American learn something from my poor experience and use that to create a better experience for the next guy. On Tuesday 4 October I knew the flight I was originally on for Thursday 6 October was going to get screwed up due to the impending hurricane so I tried to be proactive and call American. I was charged ~$720 to change the flight to Wednesday 5 October. My friend who was also on that same flight, waited until hours later to change his flight. Since a weather alert was issued, he was charged $0 to change his flight. Now you would think that American would be happy that I was proactive and allowed them to be organized, but when I called in and asked for a refund since I thought it was ridiculous that I was charged ~$720 for being proactive, my request naturally was rejected. On Monday 10 October I was booked on flight AA68 leaving at 10:30am. The flight was delayed because there was an oil leak. The original flight was postponed to Tuesday 11 October, however we offered a free transfer to a different flight taking off at 3 pm (4.5 hours later). As a reparation, we were offered food that had already been expired (see picture 1). Finally after boarding the flight, I was given a seat with a defective television screen so I had to stare at a screen with inverted colors while the rest of my flight was able to enjoy a movie. Fortunately, this gave me plenty of time to think about what an awful job American has done on my last 3 flights. American Airlines has just come off of a record year making $7.6 billion dollars. The last two times I've worked with American I gave them roughly $2,000 worth of business. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. Every single flight was delayed, I was fed expired food, I was charged over $700 to change a flight before a natural disaster that you allowed other clients to change for free.

American Airlines,2,Lydia Bowman,16th October 2016,"Norfolk to Orlando. My husband and I booked American through Cheap Flights.com and I have never regretted a reservation like I have this one. First, on our flight to Florida, we had to cancel and rebook our flight on the day of FIVE times. We were never notified that our original flight was cancelled, and even once we signed up for alerts, no one ever called me to rebook flights. We finally got a flight out as we were dropping off friends at the airport and checked with the American ticketer, for a flight an hour from that time. Thankfully, our family was able to bring our packed luggage but we had to undo cancellations for our hotel, find a completely different car rental, and did not arrive in Florida until 1 AM. That, however, pales in comparison to today. We got up at 3 for our 5.15 flight, only to find at the airport that flight had been ""cancelled"" and we were moved to a 6.35 flight, with unassigned seats and are currently waiting assignment. This is so unacceptable and unprofessional, I am at a loss for words. The individuals who work here are wonderful, but the company is terrible.

American Airlines,2,Mary Beth Labate,9th October 2016,"When we booked our flights several months ago there was not a direct flight from Charlotte to Albany so we booked via Chicago, recognizing how circuitous and inconvenient it would be. When we arrived at the Charlotte airport for our flight home to Albany we noticed that there was a direct flight to Albany and were told that there were many seats available. We asked if we could be out I that flight but at every turn were told that it was against company policy and that such a change would cost $200 each. We realize what ""the policy"" is but were hoping in a rationale, customer focused world we could get on a flight with vacancies that was going directly to Albany rather than having to fly halfway across the country only to return to the east coast. Of course the rationale is that the direct flight ""might"" have cost less than the flight we booked. When I asked for a comparison of the costs of the 2 flights at the time we booked it the airline said there was no way they could tell. Even though many airlines look for every conceivable angle to make money off their customers it's a shame that American assumes the same pecuniary motives from their customers. And so a flight to Albany with plenty of empty seats will leave soon. We won't be on it. But we will be on the flight leaving at a nearby gate to Chicago and once there we will hop a flight to Albany. Bureaucratic policies which focus solely on the bottom line rather than on the customer ultimately will damage the bottom line.

American Airlines,1,Wayne Smith,5th October 2016,"Chicago to Manchester with American Airlines. Worst flight ever. Route was and is advertised with personal entertainment system choice of movies etc. Plane advertised as 787. Instead what we got was a 30 year old 767 that still had its original interior. 6 screens on the centre ceiling that you needed binoculars to see. The seats were very uncomfortable as they were the same age as the aircraft. I asked the staff if the plane was a joke, he said it was a last resort plane as they had technical issues with the Dreamliner, which I since found out was untrue. According to AA customer service the flight was changed several weeks earlier and is still being used to date as they said in their words ""we used this aircraft because it was more profitable"". The fact that it is advertised with all the mod cons did not concern them at all. The magazine in the seat pocket was all stuck together and some of them were totally in Spanish. The movie was a Disney movie and the people who made the outbound journey on this flight said the movie was in Spanish and could not be changed. The flight was unable to carry any duty free items as they didn't have anywhere to store it. AA customer service offered us a voucher for $100 off our next flight but like I told them ""Why would we ever fly with them again on a 30 year old aircraft when there are far superior carriers out there that actually give you what you pay for?""

I sat on hold for 40 min and less than a minute into the conversation the call was disconnected. They made no attempt to reconnect with me. Consequently I was forced to call back. Sat on hold for another 40 plus mins. The representative did nothing in order to help me resolve this issue. Her solution was for me to purchase another ticket. This did not seem to be a customer friendly solution. As a last resort to find a mutually beneficial and reasonable solution to my situation I asked to speak with the manager.

American Airlines,1,Jacob Bracher,2nd October 2016,"If you are flying somewhere with connecting flights, this is not the airline for you. I paid $525 dollars to get from Gainesville, Florida to Maruqette, Michigan. I got delayed in Charlotte two times to Chicago and then both flights got cancelled. I ended up getting to Chicago past midnight where I had to sit in the airport until 3 AM where I asked to speak to a supervisor. It took her over ten minutes to come in which she proceeded to stand over in a corner and stare at everyone until one of the customer service representatives had to go remind her that I was waiting for her. When she comes over and I tell her what's going on, she denies me assistance because ""she can only help me if one of the customer assistance ladies can't help me."" Then she rudely told me, ""I'm going to direct you to the line behind you to speak to a customer representative."" After walking into the line and waiting I was speaking to the lady about rebooking my flight to Marquette. Marquette was full that day and I would have been number 13 on standby. So my options were either take a plane to Greenbay (which is 3 hours from Marquette) or wait another 36 hours in an airport to fly to Marquette. Obviously my hands were tied and I chose to go to Greenbay. I was put on standby for an 8:40 AM flight and confirmed on a flight at noon. I sat in the airport until 8 and by this point I had been up over 24 hours. The flight at 8:40 was a bit delayed, and I waited until almost everyone boarded before approaching the boarding assistant and asking them if there were any seats available for people on standby. She asked for my name, I gave it to her, and she told me I wasn't on the standby list. I showed her my ticket proving I was and she denied still that I was on the standby list. She then proceeded to ignore me for a few minutes before closing the flight, telling me she can't help me, and walked away. I needed to get on that flight because I had no way of getting from Marquette to Greenbay except for a friend who could pick me up if I had gotten on the earlier flight. I end up going up to some other people who worked at American Airlines and asked for a supervisor. They asked what the problem was and I told them. They kept telling me I wasn't on the standby list and there was nothing they could do. They ended up telling me to ""go away because there's nothing they can do to help me."" When I finally got to speak to a supervisor, she told me I ended up getting confirmed on the 8:40 flight and there was no way for me to know. This means that their worker neglected to check if I was confirmed and forced me to miss my flight for no reason other than pure laziness. When I finally get to Greenbay, I ask the supervisor there to get me to Marquette somehow. He just shrugged and told me ""he can't help me because I said it was okay for them to get me to Greenbay."" My hands were tied, I had no choice. I ended up having to rend a car for $200 and driving 3 hours sleep deprived to finally get to my destination. So while I had to pay $525 for my ticket, I ended up having to pay a total of $725 just to get to my destination.

An AA employee told a couple in a very annoyed voice ""Sir, I just came over here to get away from those people and their endless questions. Why don't you come back in ten minutes"". All of the passengers from that flight had already waited patiently for two hours without a word from AA staff. When we finally got a flight to Dallas (not final destination) the cabin crew was clearly not getting along.

I must also give a nod to staff on the phone customer service for his pleasant nature and helpfulness.

As stated before the staff were not exactly rude, just not pleasant and did the bare minimum they had to. The inflight entertainment is non-existant as neither the 737 outbound or the 757 inbound have seat back screens, just the aisle screens which give no choices and showed terrible entertainment.

'Next show in 25 minutes'. This all occurred on a very dated plane which was changed at last minute we were told by the unpleasant staff at JFK. That meant that the seats we had selected when we checked in online had been given to someone else and we had been assigned seats in the middle row. Tried to change the seats at the gate before boarding as we were instructed to do so by the airline staff upon checking in our bags but dealing with the ground staff at Gate 14 Terminal 8 in JFK was an absolutely shocking experience. The most horrendous level of customer service I have experienced from an airline or any company for that matter!

American Airlines,5,S Pickup,18th September 2016,"San Jose (Costa Rica) to Madrid via Miami and Philadelphia with American Airlines. We have been travelling around the world for over a year and we have taken many different companies. But for an international carrier AA have got to be one of the poorest. Maybe we have been spoilt and if you were to ask me what the main issue was I couldn't point it out. All our flights were on time and our connections were made which was good but I felt the service was just lacking, especially when compared to other international carriers. And it's the little things that I remember. No ear plugs or eye masks, paying $8 for a whisky, typical American advertising over the PA for a credit card.

The flight out of PVD was delayed a few minutes, and we landed at ORD just a few minutes late. However, AA had no gates available and we pulled to the side of the runway and with the engines off waited over an hour before we were brought to a gate to de-plane. I then missed my connecting flight to FNT. The gate agent sent me out to the ticket counter (it's now 10:00pm) and after waiting nearly 2 hours on line, I was told there were no more flights to FNT today, that the following day was all booked, and that maybe they could get me out 2 days later, maybe to another airport like Midland-Bay City, or Grand Rapids or something. No hotel voucher, no meal voucher, no rebooking, no accommodation, nothing at all: simply put, I was abandoned in mid-journey.

The choices of programmes were rich and updated that I'd watched a total of three movies. The system was also user-friendly since almost all the programmes contained subtitles of various languages.

American Airlines,1,Y Richie,10th September 2016,"Verified Review | Baltimore to St Thomas via Charlotte with American Airlines. We had never taken any flights with AA before so we didn't know what to expect. Our flight was scheduled to leave BWI at 8:45am. We arrived at the airport at 6:45am. We boarded our plane at about 8:30 am, we then sat for 2 hours before we were told that we had missed our connecting flight from CLT to St Thomas and there were no more flights leaving and we would have to stay the night. Now this was a problem because we had a nonrefundable reservation at our hotel so we were going to lose a day of our vacation. Eventually, after calling customer service from the plane. We were booked on another flight leaving from Washington DC to Miami. So we get off the plane and take a $100 cab ride for a flight scheduled to leave Dulles at 12:45pm. We get there at about 12:15pm, go through security again, and make it the plane, only to sit on this plane for another 2 hours. Finally we leave and fly to Miami for a flight scheduled to leave a 5:55pm. We're sitting in the airport for 45 minutes and 10 minutes before the flight time they tell us to go to another gate which is in a total different wing of the terminal. So we run to the gate only to find out our 5:55pm flight is delayed. An hour later we board only to sit on yet another plane for almost 2 hours. We made it to St Thomas at 10:30pm. We were originally scheduled to arrive there at 3:30pm. So here we are 16 hours later, and have missed a half a day of our vacation, and AA thinks that was ok. The only thing they could say was oh well, you took the flight, you got there. Our return from St Thomas back home was about the same. Sitting in airports at the wrong gates and delayed flights.

We flew in on a Friday evening without incident with a return flight beginning on Sunday afternoon from Syracuse to Philadelphia to Wilmington NC. We were left a message at 1145pm on Saturday night that our flight was cancelled. Luckily, we had been up to receive the message and called back 15 minutes later. The American Airlines representative my husband talked to looked for another flight out of Syracuse for about 15 seconds, told him there were none and insisted that we had to drive to Buffalo or Albany if we wanted to fly out Sunday. We were given no explanation for the cancelled flight and the representative refused to look again for any flights out of Syracuse unless we went out Monday instead. So we inquired about a Rochester flight which was our closest option and booked one. Having jobs we had to get back to. My father in law drove us to and from Rochester.

A long weekend getaway shortened by delay and cancellations by American Airlines without explanation or customer support.

It also meant the cost of three taxi rides to and from airport d/t the cancellation and then again the following day. Day 2 early morning flight once again, both initial flight and connecting flight, now wasting a full vacation day. Return flight was a repeat of the departure experience with a delay of the initial flight, hourly delays with the connecting flight, and yet another cancellation. Repeated calls to American Airlines, over four weeks, means being transferred to yet another number, only to be told to go online and request refunds, etc. There will be no response to emails.

The on-plane service was good, the staff friendly and professional and the food was surprisingly very good. The plane was old, with no charging stations or personal entertainment system at individual seats (and I wouldn't call a hanging aisle TV, set at mute, playing some random old movies any kind of entertainment). However, what made the flight especially bad for me was the seat. I had an aisle seat, which I generally like, but the aisle armrest was of the type that couldn't be lifted and the entire flight its corner was constantly eating into my leg. It was 8+ hours of suffering, in a plane which was insufficiently cool. The flight cost just over $500 one way and I think that's a little too much for an old plane with uncomfortable seats and no technology whatsoever.

Talk about the benefit of a merger. More than a weather delay, it was a blatant organizational failure. After 5 hours of delay, we were offered the famous airport sandwich, but that's insulting for other sandwiches to call it that. In Aug 16 we took 4 flights with American, for a total of 11 hours delay. It costed us money and precious time.

Frantic as I was to locate it, I called OIA and LAX. I must say each and everyone I called were friendly and sympathetic to my problem. When my daughter and I arrived home and realized she had left it on the plane, she went back to OIA and American Airlines Baggage claim advised they did not have it, but to check back the next day. Her plane had already taken back off for somewhere else. My daughter was due in Asheville, NC, so she left from OIA and drove to Asheville. She tried calling on her way up and I spent hours on the phone trying to figure out where that plane had gone. There was a gentleman at LAX by the name of KEN that was very helpful and I thanked him.

American Airlines,1,Frank Malquist,2nd September 2016,"Boise to Northwest Arkansas via Dallas Ft Worth. Round trip flight with four legs, first was late, second was canceled twice on two different days, third on time, fourth was late. The canceled flights was the worst. We started late, sat on the tarmac for one hour and returned to the gate. This was weather related and I am ok with that. As soon as we got inside the terminal they announced that the flight was canceled. They also would not give us our luggage, including gate checked luggage, which for us was a wheelchair. Fortunately one of the gate crew retrieved the wheelchair for us. Otherwise it would have been an even greater disaster. When we asked for our luggage they told us it would be at XNA when we got there. When we asked about lodging and meals we were informed that they have no obligation to provide that for weather related issues. When asked about future flights we were told the first available seats were for 8:00 PM the next day. In about an hour the plane left with our luggage for another itinerary. So much for weather related cancellation. They canceled us so they could use that plane for a more profitable flight. That to me that quit being a weather related issue and became a business issue. They did book us on a flight for the next morning. (so much for no seats until 8 PM) When we arrived at the airport that flight had been canceled also. I didn't hear the reason as we were scrambling to get a car to drive up. When we got there our luggage was waiting for us as evidenced by the computer showing it there and the agent being able to deliver it to us and confirm delivery on her computer. Unknown to us, they canceled our return flights the next day. Probably because we never made the second leg of our itinerary. They obviously knew we made it there because we picked up our luggage. I suppose their computers aren't capable of talking to each other. I didn't find out our reservations had been canceled until a week later when I tried to check in and they couldn't find us. I called their help desk and was told the flight from DFW to BOI was fully booked, then after further research they restored all our reservation except for our seats. When I logged in to chose our seats I found quite a few available on both flights, the only downside was that I had to pay an extra $170 because these were considered premium seats, even though two were center seats.

Boarding was quick after that. The plane was in the new livery. There were no televisions, so I slept for most of it. As for the seats, I did not recline because there was a person behind me. Something that I was a little surprised is that after serving drinks and snacks, the flight attendants stayed in the back, and did not come out until it was time to serve another drink. Surely you should occasionally walk down the aisle and offer help and check everything? Our time in Phoenix was quick, just enough to use the restroom, and connect gates (we had to change terminals) This plane had the old livery.

Let me clarify, I didn't choose American, I would avoid at all costs in future. The reason I was on American is I booked flights via Skyscanner and it was a BA flight with flight share by American - pity, I swear Ryanair or Jet2 have more legroom. Also as I booked late, I hadn't managed to secure a window seat which I always make use of by guess what? yeh looking out of the window, I really don't get people who have window seats and then have the blind down all of the journey - I don't get it!

American Airlines,1,Stephanie Spoto,28th August 2016,"I guess I should start off by saying that this is the first negative review I’ve ever written. I’m normally not one to bash people on the grounds that I like to think the intention is always there, but there is no getting around my last experience with American Airlines. Okay..where do I start. My friends and I are flying from Managua, Nicaragua to Rochester, NY with connecting flights from Managua to Miami, Miami to Charlotte, Charlotte to ROC. Everything is going smoothly up until there is a 30 minute (which turns into an unannounced 50 minute) delay on the Miami to Charlotte flight…which is fine. Delays happen, I get it. However, noticing that we would probably be cutting it close to our next flight, my friend goes to ask if there were other flights we could look into it if we didn't catch it. She starts by saying that we have a connecting flight - until he cuts her off and says “-yeah, you and everyone else.” That was the end of the conversation. I also am not naive to the fact that when people are under stress they can come off as rude, but why work in customer service if you cant handle people? So wheels are down at 10:10 PM in Charlotte and our next flight departs at 10:20 PM - when we get there it’s gone. They could’ve waited 5 minutes if they knew that was the last flight out! Anyway, so we get up to the front desk after an hour wait in customer service and although the lady is very sweet, she has no idea what she's doing. It takes about 40 minutes for her to get us a hotel and book us flight the next day from Charlotte to Chicago, Chicago to ROC. We notice the next morning that there was a direct flight to Buffalo available that we said we’d be willing to fly into, but she didn't even inform us about it. So after we fly into Chicago, we get to the gate just in time to check in - only to find out that we’re not even confirmed for the flight!! The man is rude and not helpful at all; he shoos us away to the customer service phone. Thankfully, I was on standby for that flight and had a back-up flight through United (unlike my friends). So we make the trek over to the United terminal and a lady solved all our problems in about 15 minutes, all while being personable, friendly, and professional. Turns out I wasn’t even confirmed for the United flight, but she made sure I was while also confirming later flights for my friends.

American Airlines,2,Natalie Barch,28th August 2016,"Verified Review | Ft Myers to Dallas with American Airlines. Our flight was delayed an hour and half and we would miss our next connecting flight. There were no other flights that day so they booked flights for us the next day. We were pleasantly surprised that we would be put up in a hotel free of charge for the night until we got to the hotel only to be told that no one had called from the airline to book our room and we were not given the proper documentation to do so. We called the 800 number and were rudely told they did not handle hotel issues over the phone and that we needed to return to the airport. When we got to the airport no one was behind the desk so we paged for an employee to come to the desk twice. We waited for over 30 minutes before a supervisor showed up behind the desk.

We then called the 800 number again and we talked to a very helpful employee who was able to contact another supervisor who was still at the airport. This supervisor was very nice and fixed our problem right away. She printed off our hotel voucher and even gave us complimentary breakfast for in the morning.

I was already in town and was going to pick him up late last night so we could drive the 5hrs in the early morning. He waited at the PHX airport last night from 5:30pm until past 10pm (flight originally scheduled to depart at 8:15pm) when he was finally told his flight was rescheduled for the following morning (today). He then went home and back to the airport today for his supposed flight at 10am, which again was cancelled. This has ruined our trip and their online refund tool only accounts for the ticket price not taxes or surcharges, transportation (he took 3 additional Uber's), or our return flight which he will no longer be able to take. We have been looking forward to this trip for months and do not get to see my niece very often, this is devastating for us. My fiancé even took days off work that he will no longer be able to get back. He even called late last night to verify that the flight this morning was scheduled because he could not find it online, the woman who answered was extremely rude and told him it was scheduled, which was not true.

American Airlines,9,Antonis Asprakis,26th August 2016,"Despite the many negative reviews I have read about American Airlines, I found this Philadelphia to Athens return trip to offer a significantly better product than British Airways, which I flew exclusively for many years on transatlantic flights. With AA, my partner and I were able to choose regular economy seats for free in advance, and the A330 with its 2x4x2 configuration is preferable to the dense 3x3x3 configuration BA offers out of PHL (no stranger sitting next to us). Also, the seat pitch is better then BA's new claustrophobic arrangement, and the seats themselves were much more comfortable. In addition, the A330 offered individual air vents, which BA do not on their aircraft out of PHL, allowing me to better control the temperature. The food on AA was better than BA as well, and complimentary wine was offered with meals, with refills freely provided. The AVOD system worked well and a USB power port was provided at each seat. Flight attendants on both flights were very courteous, and the ATH-PHL segment featured a warm meal, followed later by ice cream, followed by a snack, and then followed with a warm sandwich and a muffin prior to landing - very impressed. After this experience I will be choosing AA for all my future transatlantic travel out of PHL.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PHL to ATH,August 2016,5,5,5,4,5,5,yes
American Airlines,1,Jason Vestweber,25th August 2016,"Verified Review | I have traveled a great deal during my 46 years, and I've experienced plenty of delays, cancellations, and typical air travel mishaps. However, on a recent flight with American Airlines back from New York we landed at Chicago O'Hare Airport on a bright, sunny Sunday afternoon only to learn that our 11.20 am flight back into Cedar Rapids had been cancelled. When we went to rebooking, we quickly learned there were no available seats to CID until the next day at 10.00 am. Now this is where the frustration kicks in. Rebooking told us to find a gate agent, they would be able to help. We found a gate agent and asked for help. She educated us that rebooking should have sent us to the main ticket desk. So, we went back out through security to the main ticket counter. There we were told we would not receive any compensation for rental car, or hotel. Clearly this was not a weather related issue.

What a pleasant flight, the captain was full of courtesy informing us of flying time and we made it. On the flight from DFW to JFK we couldn't check in online, and we were late and almost missed our flight. It reflected full but we had empty seats on take off.

This criticism is less about the flight rather the complete lack of service by AA at Seattle Airport. We arrived for our flight home to Florida to find a long, long line of waiting passengers. Eventually a man from American Airlines walked along the line and told us ""All flights out are cancelled due to bad weather in Dallas, wait in line to see what options are available "" After a 3 hour wait (I am 68 years old and with a bad back) where American had 1 staff member working for economy passengers and 5 others that I counted standing around doing nothing we gave up and went to try to find a hotel. Where is the concept or understanding of ""Customer Service""? Is is completely beyond the ability of American Airlines to get their staff to actually serve their customers or is it that they just don't care about anyone anymore?

American Airlines,1,M Zettee,24th August 2016,"Verified Review | American Airlines overbooked for the leg of my trip from Philadelphia to Chicago, then decided to use a different type of airplane, which apparently required calling in a different crew. As a result I was delayed in Philadelphia for two hours, then held on the runway at Chicago for an hour, which caused me to just miss my connecting flight from Chicago to Oklahoma City. When we finally did arrive at the gate in Chicago, there was no one there to assist me in getting another flight, despite the fact that the delay was due to their decisions and also despite the fact that I was supposed to have wheelchair service at all stops. I also did not have wheelchair service at Philadelphia like I was supposed to. I am disabled and I ended up having to walk the Chicago O'Hare concourse to a different gate I was directed to, only to be told at that gate that they could not help me and I would need to use the rebooking phone to book the remainder of my flight home myself. To top it off, the rebooking phone agent was not able to assist me with hotel or food vouchers, or with information about my bags. For that, I had to stand in the domestic ticketing line for two hours, then I was issued a hotel voucher that ended up being worthless because too many vouchers were issued for that hotel, and they were full. By the time I discovered this, the AA domestic ticket counter was closed for the night, so my only option was to book a hotel last minute on my own. I have emailed AA customer service, but have so far received no reply, despite the fact that it has been four days since I emailed.

American Airlines,7,Tobias Geb,23rd August 2016,"Flight AA56 from Miami to London Heathrow with American Airlines. I flew in Main Cabin Extra on a Boeing 777-300ER. The groud service in Miami checked our bags even though you were supposed to do it on your own at a digital kiosk. When I boarded I didn't find a toothbrush set on my seat which is very disappointing on an overnight flight. The legroom was amazing, and that's what you expect when flying Main Cabin Extra. The seats were a bit wider than in normal Economy but didn't recline enough. They weren't as comfortable as the soft and comfy BA B747 ones and I wasn't able to sleep at all. The IFE was good with a huge range of music, many TV shows, and a adequate music on- demand radio choice. The power outlets were universal and it charged fast unlike the USB plug of the IFE. The service was good and kind, provided 3 drinks but you can ask them anytime to give you another one. The meal (I chose pasta) was pretty good, and came with a salad with dressing, a bun, crackers, cheddar, butter and a brownie. The breakfast was a fat free strawberry yougurt, a little bag of cereal for the yogurt, a cranberry snack and a flat over-processed muffin.

We then sat on the tarmac for another hour while ground crew loaded baggage. We finally take off and arrive in Miami expecting to have to have someone at American Airlines find us another flight to Santa Cruz. But, the flight to La Paz/Santa Cruz had been delayed also. We ran and made that plane only to sit on the Tarmac in Miami for another hour plus (the other passengers had been waiting much longer than that). Finally we took off for La Paz where we were to remain on the plane for our continuing flight to Santa Cruz. We waited, and waited and after around 2 hours the captain informed us that the crew had passed it's legal time and was deplaning. So we deplaned and went through customs. Finally we arrived at the AA counter where we stood another 2 hours in line only to be given an 80.00 bolivian voucher for breakfast which didn't come close to paying for anything to eat but we appreciated the effort. AA apparently was not able to complete its obligation to get us to our destination so they put us on a BOA plane and got us to Santa Cruz after another nearly 6 hour wait. The last part may not come as a surprise but for good measure the luggage was still sitting in Miami when we arrived in Santa Cruz.

The best way to discuss the flight attendant on the flight to DFW was ""robotic"". She literally went ""through the motions"" of providing service and nothing else. The breakfast meal, yogurt, a granola bar and orange juice, was uninspiring. Transferring in DFW was easy. There were 2 attendants in first class on the flight to Charlotte. Both were much better than the one I had going to DFW. The meal, itself, left a lot to be desired. The ""hot"" towels that were passed out were room-temperature; so were the ""warm"" nuts. I had ravioli that was served with a ""salad"" which consisted of lettuce, one grape tomato that was sliced in half, and a cucumber slice. The salad dressing was straight of a packet. The ravioli were OK. Actually, the best part of the meal was the pretzel roll that was served with the meal. It was quite good. Sadly, there was no dessert.

I checked the flight online and discovered that there were 8 available seats. Another phone call back to AA.

American Airlines,1,John Doe,21st August 2016,"Wilmington, NC to Lubbock, TX. I'd rather drive cross country than use American Airlines again. Due to a death in the family, I was trying to fly my wife in to attend the funeral. The day of her flight, we got 5 departure time updates in 30 minutes, the last of which pushing up the departure time an hour and thirty minutes from the original posted time. Because we were traveling over that just to get to the airport, although I sped, ran red lights, etc, they would not allow her on the plane even though it was still connected to the airbridge and she missed that flight. Although they were ""willing to work with us"" (if that's what you want to call it), their make up flight for her wasn't supposed to leave until the next day, it was taking her to an airport 2.5 hours north of where she needed to be, and it wasn't even going to arrive until after the funeral. After some back and forth between myself and the ticket counter, I worked out a deal where she would fly from Wilmington, NC to Charlotte, NC, stay the night, and then depart on a United Airlines flight from Charlotte, NC to Dallas and stay on United Airlines from Dallas to her final destination. Well, at 0645 this morning, my wife calls to inform me that although American Airlines printed her a boarding pass with a seat number and everything, they failed to fund the flight change from American to United, so she will now not be allowed on that flight either. Their final fix to the problem is to now send her from Charlotte to Atlanta to Dallas to her final destination all on American Airlines. Her flight won't get in until 2 hours after the funeral, but I guess I should just be happy she's going to get to go home at this point (assuming they don't screw this up too, of which I'm not confident). I dread to see how bad they're going to screw us on the return trip. Their coordination, communication, and customer support is hands down the worst I've ever encountered. Everyone we've dealt with so far (around 7 individuals) have all given us attitude and been unwilling to put in a little leg work to fix the problem that their airline created in the first place. American Airlines is an absolute joke of an airline and an organization. If there were more steps that I knew of to take this matter further up the chain of command, I would, but because subordinate actions are a reflection of leadership, I wouldn't expect anything to come of it. If I could give advice to any new traveler, avoid American Airlines at all costs. I'm not here to advocate other airlines, but I can tell you that if you go with American and are depending on them to get you where you need to go when you need to get there, you'll be greatly disappointed and just as frustrated as I am right now with them.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ILM to LBB,August 2016,2,2,2,,1,1,no

This is the first time I fly with American Airlines and will be the last time. My husband and I flew from Charlotte, NC to Santa Ana, CA and there was just delay after delay. I really didn't mind the delay at all because I knew that there was nothing that they could have done, what is done is done. But were there not any protocol to check the plane before letting passenger board the airplane? We sat there for a hour before they told us that everyone have to leave the airplane because they couldn't fix it and they need to give us a new airplane. So our flight was supposed to depart at 6:30 a.m. but we did not depart until 8:30 a.m. We got back on the plane and sit there for another hour because there was some ""computer glitches."" Obviously, we missed our connecting flight. Once we landed in Dallas to try to catch our connecting flight that we already missed, the staff handed us some new boarding pass to our new connecting flight which was a thumb up. But wait, that wasn't it. They gave us the wrong boarding pass, because while my husband and I waited for our plane to get boarded, we heard over the intercom, ""Last call for (our names) to Santa Ana."" My husband and I look at each other and was confuse on why do another flight have our names instead of the flight we were supposed to get on by the boarding pass the staff hand out to us. Well, we couldn't complain because it was an earlier flight or we will have to wait for another hour, but we were really concern about our baggages. When we arrived to Santa Ana, we did got our baggages, so that was maybe one thing that AA did right. On our flight back home, everything was going well. The flight were on time, no delays, we didn't have any problem. But once we arrive to Phoenix for our connecting flight, there were some problems. When I handed that staff my boarding pass, I couldn't board, because I ""did not check in."" If I did not check in, how did I arrived to Phoenix from California? And how did I have my boarding pass in my hand? My mother in law and husband is checked in and able to board, but I wasn't able to when we obviously all checked in together. Obviously AA is horrible with delay, so they obviously bump me off the flight and give my seat to someone else that flight was delay. My husband was not having it, after throwing a little scene, they offered to give me a $500 voucher and a hotel room. Of course, I was not having it, time could not be bought. But thankfully another passenger volunteer to stay so I could take their seat. But it's ridiculous how my seat was given to someone else and they overbooked the flight.

American Airlines,2,Laura Rodriguez,13th August 2016,"Verified Review | I normally do not review, however beyond disappointed in the service received!!! Flying out of Cleveland, OH to Corpus Christi, TX, my connecting flight had an hour and 20 minute layover in Dallas, TX. Not only was my flight delayed 3 times, which would have left me missing my connecting flight by 30 minutes, my connection was delayed and I missed that by 10 minutes thanks to waiting for my plain to taxi. American Airlines was nice enough to put me up in a hotel for the evening (even if I had no clothes, toiletries, etc since everything was checked, I at least had a bed) my connecting flight showed a printed time of 0820, American showed the flight on their screens as 0850 on time (would have been nice to know since I could have afforded the extra sleep). On the shuttle over to the airport finding out from flight attendants that American Airlines is up for contract reviews so all of their flights have been ""coincidently"" late/delayed for malfunctions. Low and behold my flight home has been delayed twice now, first to the AC once again not being to the pilots liking, and now because he'd like to check the brakes again (I'm all about safety so by no means am I upset over the last issue). However what spurred the outrage was when I decided to speak with Customer Service. I politely and softly asked if we would possibly be leaving in the late morning/early afternoon so I could make arrangements for both meetings and travel back home, only to be rudely yelled at the attendant at the gate quite loudly stating that the brakes were an important part of the plane. Now I can understand if there had been multiple guest that asked rude questions how her ""customer service"" skills could have been strained, however no one had spoken with her and her immediate answer was defensive, hostile and rude to a simple, polite question, American Airlines maybe while you are ""negotiating contracts"" you take your guest who faithfully fly with you into consideration and retrain your staff in customer service skills to be slightly more understanding and just polite to the innocent bystanders that just want to get home to their families.

American Airlines,1,S Stanbouli,12th August 2016,"Chicago to Dallas with American Airlines. When you try to check-in online you find that all the seats cost extra unless you want a middle seat by the bathroom or galley. I purchased the Main Cabin Extra upgrade based on what they claimed the benefits are, but they withheld important information that would have made the exorbitant price they charged not worth it. One of their claims is that you get priority boarding - that is after all the AAdvantage and many other categories have boarded. By the time we boarded (Group 1) the plane was already full and there was no room for a backpack under the seat in front of me. The passenger in front of me had a huge bag overhead, another under the seat in front of him, and another under his seat. The passengers that did not fall for this upgrade trap saved themselves $180 and got exactly the same privilege and inconvenience as me. So a piece of advice - never upgrade online, you will get the same seats and inconvenience for free.

American Airlines,1,Basil Willett,11th August 2016,"The flight from Orlando to Philadelphia, AA1666 was delayed for over 1 hour, the pilot announced that he would try to catch up as he knew that there were people on board who had a connection to catch and would the passengers allow these people to leave the plane first. He made up about half an hour and the passengers ignored his request, taking us over 15 miutes to exit from row 30, giving us about 10 minutes to run from 16B to 269A. As an 83 year old man with an 81 year old lady, it is a wonder that we did not have a heart attack as the temp was 95 degrees. We reached A24 in time to meet a family of 4 who were walking back and informed us that they had shut the gate and would not wait. This was for flight AA734. They said they had been told to go to ""customer service"", a very long walk back. Here we were dealt with by the worlds worst and slowest typist. She proceeded to produce boarding passes for 2 of us and the 4 other passengers. She printed out 8 boarding passes, stared at each one and then threw them in the trash. She then produced 2 more, 1 at each side of the plane, I gave them back and she eventually gave me 2 for row 30. The other party asked for 4 seats together, not near a toilet, so they were eventually given 4 seats next to the toilets for the next day. This operation took her well over an hour, she then told us to go outside where a mini bus would take us to a ""hotel"". The 11 seater mini bus arrived with 7 passengers already on board and asked us to climb in, I sat on the edge of a seat with my foot in the door well and my lady companion sat on the spare wheel. We were then taken 25 miles to the ""Hotel"" which turned out to be a motel. By this time we were all very hungry as we had not eaten for about 10 hours only to be told that there would be no food until breakfast the next day. At this point I asked if I could make a phone call as there would be a taxi waiting for me in Manchester. Surprise, surprise the young man in reception informed me that they did not have a phone, I said they must be the only ""hotel"" in the world without a phone. He said they did not have an outside line. and there was no mobile network. As the taxi arrived in Manchester and waited 2 hours and returned home empty I have had to pay £125 instead of the £55 which I should have paid on the correct day. The next morning we were told that the only trip back to the airport was at 10.30 am so the 13 passengers again crammed into the 11 seater mini bus and we were taken back to the airport to catch our flight at 8.55 pm, after a half hour trip back we then had to wait in the airport we had to wait for aprox. 10 hours. I have travelled the world since I was 18 years old, have been delayed for 24 hours on three accasions but have never felt the need to complain before, but this experience was the most chaotic of my life so far.

I'm actually waiting for my plane right now as I type this and I've been waiting for 4 hours from its original boarding time. Also no one updates us on our flight, for example boarding time was 06:50 pm and it was 06:45 and the plane was still not there. No updates on what's going on, everyone was confuse. This happened 3 times.

American Airlines,1,Brian Parker,10th August 2016,"Two of us flying from LAS to LAX. Paid extra for bulkhead seats and Group 1 boarding priority. When we arrived at our seats, the overhead bins were crammed full half way down the aircraft. In fact, the bin over our seats was occupied by an out of uniform LAX based flight attendant seated in the back of the aircraft! I placed my bag in the first available space, and struggled to get back up the aisle to my seat. My partner had a small, soft-sided bag, and we placed it under the last row of first class seats, in front of the bulkhead, a very secure location. The flight attendants completed their pre take off checks, and never mentioned a problem with the location of the carry on bag. Prior to landing, a crew member walked through the cabin, spotted the bag under the first class seat, and went ballistic at us. She shouted that it was against FAA policy to have a bag in that location. We said, ""fine, no problem, we're happy for you to move it."" She snatched the bag, put it in a first class bin, came back, and proceeded to scold us like naughty children, shouting, again, that it was against FAA policy to have a bag in that location, and told us that ""we had better put it in am overhead bin next time!"" She stormed off, and I was shaking with anger. Since I had to wait after landing to retrieve my bag from the back, I decided I would wait until all of the customers were off the aircraft so I could get her name. I approached her and asked for her name, which she refused to provide. When we both attempted to discuss why we were so disgusted with her behaviour, she threw up her hands in the air, stepped back, and said ""OK, now I feel like your ganging up on me!"" and she walked away. We were totally calm and rational, she was freaking out. She came back and again told us twice about FAA regulations, and walked away, This is how American deals with customer complaints, they claim that they are feeling ""threatened"" so they don't have to address the issue. Concerned that she would be calling the police, we walked off of the aircraft, and decided to pursue the issue via other means.",Boeing 737 800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to LAX,August 2016,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,Dave Finkelstein,6th August 2016,"Sacramento to Flagstaff. Once again a completely disastrous experience with this airline. Years ago flying from Orlando to Sacramento they left us stranded in Phoenix and offered no assistance whatsoever. We literally watched them put our luggage on the plane as they slammed the door in our face and said sorry it's to late and left us stranded in Phoenix with 2 young kids without our luggage. Thank god for Southwest, we were able to buy tickets to get home the same day. All they offered after we contacted their customer service was a voucher for future flights, no refund for the flight they failed to let us board. So this experience was just as horrific! Except worse! Our departure from Sacramento was scheduled for early morning so we decided to stay at a hotel to be closer and allow us extra time. When we arrived they informed us the plane had hit a bird while landing which I completely understand is out of their control. The way they handled things were where the disaster began. There was clearly no sense of urgency from the ground crew to inspect or repair anything, no repairs were needed. None the less delayed for 2 hours made our connection to Flagstaff impossible. When we asked to get on the next flight we were informed by another non-caring American Airlines employee that the rest of the flights for the day were full so they could only get us there the next morning. For a 30 minute flight we opted to rent a car and drive so we wouldn't loose any more of our already shortened weekend time with our daughter. When we asked for our luggage they rudely informed us that we would have to wait until it showed up in Flagstaff later that night - and you'll never guess but that flight was delayed too! When we arrived at the Flagstaff airport Sunday after our shortened weekend visit with our daughter, they checked us through security, took our bags and then informed everyone they had an issue with one of the plane doors and we would be delayed. After about an hour they informed everyone that they were sending a bus to pick us up and drive us to Phoenix since they were unable to resolve the door issue. Once again missing our connection flight back home. We again opted to rent a car and head on our own way so we would be assured of getting to Phoenix as quickly as possible.

American Airlines,1,T Flammer,4th August 2016,"In an attempt to reach a memorial service in Austin, TX, I booked an American Airlines trip on 7/28/16 from Dayton, OH to Austin. It would take me through ORD, where everything would go wrong. We had no issues flying into ORD, arriving at 1200 CT. The connecting flight to AUS was scheduled for 1400 CT, but was delayed for an hour and a half (AA1474). The delays continued as the ticket counter informed us repeatedly that we had an aircraft but we had no crew to fly it. After delaying multiple times and moving gates three times (anyone who's flown through ORD knows how awful that is), we were finally informed that our crew had landed and were preparing to run their security checks in the aircraft. At this point, we were lined up and ready to board at 1900 CT - over 7 hours delayed because of crew issues. Out of nowhere, the counter announced the flight was cancelled but would give us no information whatsoever. The agents were rude and dismissive, only giving us re-booking numbers. Because of their ridiculous delays (how the largest US carrier doesn't have pilots on standby in one of the world's busiest airports is beyond me), there were no flights out of ORD that would get me into Austin in time for the memorial the following day. Because there was no point to travel to Austin, I requested to return home and have my money refunded to me (a fair request considering I would miss my event and I spent an entire day in ORD because their incompetence.). The agent informed me that they could only offer a voucher because the trip was marked cancelled due to weather. This was an outright lie as they repeatedly noted that it was crew related. I work in private aviation with access to FAA databases, and everything noted about the flight involves crew issues. There were even other aircraft flying at that same time from ORD to other Texas locations (DFW was a flight I attempted to fly on but was full). AA changed the cancellation reason because they aren't financially responsible to refund airfare and/or offer hotel vouchers. I even requested a food voucher at 2100 CT, and they refused that because my original flight was cancelled for weather. I have sent them multiple requests for a refund, but they refuse. They haven't even offered a phone number to contact their customer relations dept, as they only contact customers through an un-returnable email. It's absurd for them to think that I would want their voucher; I will never fly with this airline again. I would avoid them as well because when things go poorly, they will treat you like dirt and lie about it to your face.",MD-80,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DAY to AUS via ORD,July 2016,2,1,,,1,1,no

We booked our flights with American Airlines and the flight was operated by Iberia. The experience was terrible with both companies was terrible. On the flight over our flight was delayed and we missed our connection in Madrid, we were put on an extra flight that took us to Santiago and then to Palma, Mallorca. We arrived to Mallorca 12 hours delayed - that was out of the airlines control. When we went to check in for our flight back home we were told that none of us (5 passengers) were on the flight list! We stood at the check in counter for an hour and a half while the costumer service agent tried to fix the problem and give us a new booking. Apparently while our flight over was altered due to the delay and missed connection someone deleted us from the flight list on our return flights, so that we appeared on the flight list but could not have boarding passes printed. The agent was able to fix all of our flights but one, she could not figure out how to reissue the ticket for my cousin from Madrid to New York so we had to leave him behind at the airport in Madrid. Iberia staff members including supervisors told us that their ability to fix this issue was limited because it was technically an American Airlines booking, however they could not get a representative from American Airlines to be of assistance (and neither could I on my 3 international phone calls for over an hour to America Airlines) Technically my cousins ticket was canceled so all that he could do was go and buy a ticket for the following day; all that was left was a business class seat which he had to pay $5,000 for!

American Airlines,2,Vaia Iliadis,31st July 2016,"Verified Review | I would like to say how disappointed I was with my experience with American Airlines. I recently traveled overseas from Philadelphia to Athens with my family. Firstly, I expected anyone with children to be among the first to be boarded. I was, I believe the only one with a 9 month old baby in addition to my 3 1/2 year old toddler. To my surprise, and I'm sure the other parents, we never heard a ""anyone with young children, please feel free to board"" call. Secondly, I was extremely aggravated and angered that I couldn't get the bassinet and seat that goes with it for my baby and I. I called American Airlines weeks before and even 24 hours before my flight, not to mention my Travel Agent who requested that seat for me when they booked my tickets, and was told that ""we don't reserve the bassinet; it's first come, first served"". I can appreciate that and even understand that. What I can't understand is when I arrive at the gate to get it I am told that ""a bassinet is available however the seats have been taken by some people who requested the extra leg room"". I guess American Airlines is fine with giving a seat to someone for extra leg room over a baby who needs a bassinet to sleep in? I had to hold my baby for a 9 hour flight and keep handing her over to my husband to hold while I took my toddler to the bathroom or so I could eat my meal that the flight attendant kindly put aside for me. The flight attendants were the best part of the flight. Thirdly, I didn't appreciate the fact that the assigned seats for my family had my 3 1/2 year seated between two complete strangers while my husband and I were directly behind her with the baby. Obviously, my husband switched so that my child would be with me but who is in charge of seating arrangements that can't understand the concept of keeping a child together with their parents? You would think they'd keep a family of 3 with a lap baby all together but I guess I'm the only one who thinks like that. Suffice it to say, in all likeliness I will not be using American Airlines to travel in the future. I have my return tickets already booked and would probably be charged to change them or else I would switch them with another airline to return home.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,PHL to ATH,July 2016,1,5,5,1,1,1,no

Menu is repetitive if you fly a lot but the food on this flight was very tasty and the service good. Inflight entertainment is as good as it gets and the WiFi on board can be invaluable. Staff are good. I love the first two rows of business class row 3 and row 4. Always grab them if you can.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,GRU to JFK,May 2016,4,4,4,5,4,5,yes
American Airlines,2,Justin Hill,30th July 2016,"Verified Review | My wife and I were boarding our last connecting flight home (Dallas Ft Worth to Kansas) with our carry-on luggage that we had used for all previous AA flights that day but when scanning our ticket for this particular flight, the gate agents said that my wife would have to check her bag due to the size. Granted, it would be no cost to us however the frustrating part about this is they said nothing about my bag that was the exact same size, not to mention the numerous other passengers we saw pass us to board the plane with same size bags or larger. Ours both fit perfectly fine in all the overhead bins we had used in previous AA flights. I tried to ask the agent if this was necessary considering I was not asked to check mine even when it's the same size but she insisted it was. I feel as if American Airlines targeted us (my wife) for no apparent reason. We did not want to check our bags for a reason, they met the size requirements and we wanted to be able to get off the plane and not wait for our luggage. In addition to all this, they had us board the plane and sit at the gate while they fixed 3 machanical issues before pushing off. Perhaps fix the issues before loading 100s of people onto a plane with not a lot of air circulation? Needless to say we will book with any other airlines before resorting to American Airlines for our flights.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DFW to MCI,July 2016,2,2,3,2,1,3,no

Eventually get on the plane. Told we would have to wait 30mins to take off. 2 people decided they wanted to get off and so the whole flight got cancelled. Customer services were very rude with no apologies. Said they could fly me to Le Guardia but my luggage would go to JFK. Said I would get the train and I wanted my luggage back. I waited over 2 and a half hours for my luggage and missed my train. All the staff I spoke with were rude, weren't willing to help and in one case walked off whilst myself and several other passengers were talking to him. 8.5 hours in the airport. I only had 2 days in NY before flying back to the UK. I now only have one. It has ruined what has been a great month of traveling.

American Airlines,2,Laura Pritchard-Jones,29th July 2016,"London Heathrow to Cancun via Dallas Forth Worth. Worst airline I have ever travelled with. Rang me two months before my outbound flight to tell me it was overbooked so would I be prepared to change to another flight, and in compensation they would provide an upgrade to premium economy and a travel voucher. I agreed. The customer service agent told me I would need to pick the voucher up at check in. Got to the airport, checked in and asked for the voucher, to which I got the reply of 'no, that has to be sent to you, you'll have to chase it up'. Flight was delayed by over an hour due to 'paperwork issues'. This meant I missed my connection in Dallas to Cancun. No information at all was forthcoming at Dallas airport about what happened next and as it was a Sunday evening there were no other flights they could rebook me on to. They provided a voucher for a hotel, and basic food voucher but could not give me my luggage back until I arrived in Cancun, so I was left stranded on my own in Dallas without luggage, and arrived in Cancun a day late having missed the first day of my pre-organised tour. Flight attendants were useless, and didn't seem to even recognise that there were passengers on the plane - they were constantly knocking into people sat in the aisle seats. Barely any communication from the pilots. On the way back, I flew Cancun to Miami to Raleigh-Durham to Heathrow. The pilots on the Raleigh-Durham flight were much better and communicated everything. As a nervous flyer this helps a lot. Took 12 months to be able to receive compensation for the outbound flight delay and missing tour and 12 months to receive the original voucher promised to me when I was asked to change flights!

Our flight was from Cedar Rapids was delayed due to the weather, and I want to highlight the fact that AA is not giving you food & accommodation vouchers if flight was delayed due to weather. It is still a mystery how to determine a weather conditions. The sky was bright, the sun was shining, everyone else was departing and arriving on time. The weather was selective to AA exclusively. AA arranged the alternative flight for us two hours late and it was canceled due to weather again, I hate to repeat myself, but: The sky was bright, the sun was shining, everyone else was departing and arriving on time. The weather was selective to AA exclusively. After spending several extra (thanks to AA and weather) hours in Dallas airport we decided to drive to Houston. The weather was beautiful!

This is the same with the 5:50 am, 6:00 am and 6:30 am flight to Miami. How is it that the 6:59am from JFK is canceled due to weather? No compensation offered.

Now, I am in Curacao waiting for my luggage, another vacation day lost, without basic toiletries and they tell me it will arrive at my hotel in the evening. Well it is the next morning and I have no suitcase, nothing. I am still waiting on it. Why did I pay $25? I have wasted 2 vacation days for nothing. Do not book with this airline.

As a frequent flyer I knew not to expect too much of their Boeing 767-300 product. The domestic 767's are ancient, nothing has been done to the Y cabin since early 1990's. The seats are worn, uncomfortable and lacks IFE. Cabin panels are so old that they're turning yellow and everything on this plane was dirty. The safety video wouldn't play because the old aisle CRT-screens in Y wouldn't even turn on. Tray table was dirty and covered in food residue. Reading light did not work, so I was left with nothing to do for 8+ hours as again, there is no in seat IFE. American also has the nerve to charge you for headphones. Good thing I brought my own, but no, since the headphone jack wasn't working either. The only good thing about this flight was the very friendly and personal captain, who came out into the boarding area of the airport to great us with a warm welcome and some information regarding the tropical storm Darby as it would delay our flight. This captain also kept us well informed throughout the flight. Rest of flight crew was disinterested at best, which is understandable given the poor hard product they have to make do with.

Our original scheduled flights were from Chicago to Miami and from Miami to Lima. The second leg of our flight was supposed to be with LATAM airlines but of course this wasn't to be as American Airlines messed up from the start. Our first flight (from Chicago to Miami) was cancelled. We were not told why and told to call a call centre to arrange re-booking. We presumed when an airline cancel a flight the least you receive is an apology and helpful assistance with re-booking. We received no apology or assistance. We managed to book a new flight for ourselves (Chicago to Dallas and Dallas to Lima) We got on the new flight (Chicago to Dallas) and it was delayed by about 2 hours (again no apology, no explanation). We arrived in Dallas too late to catch our flight to Lima. We went to customer service in Dallas. We were given a new set of flights (Dallas to Miami and then Miami to Lima) for the following morning. Our original departure time from Chicago was 6.45pm on 21/07/16, we were now further away from our destination and leaving approx. 13 hours later, at 9.05am on 22/07/16. Next thing, we were given a hotel voucher to get a few hours sleep (it was almost midnight at this stage). Customer service told us to go and wait on hotel shuttle and ring the number on the voucher to call them if no sign after 30 minutes or so. Of course, no shuttle came! So we rang the number printed on the hotel voucher! 3 phone calls and 2 hours later, we realised that the number was wrong. We had been calling a different shuttle (it was 2am at this stage). We googled the correct number and finally got in touch with the correct hotel. Next morning, we wen to check-in staff and staff at the gate and asked them to make sure our bags were on the flight. They assured us they were! We got our flight from Dallas to Miami and Miami to Lima. Might I add, both of these flights were delayed. We arrived in Lima 1 hour and 15 minutes late and of course my bag was lost. Turns out, the bag never left Miami! We asked for the bag to be put on the next flight. We finally got out of the airport after midnight. We had a taxi waiting to collect us for 2 hours. I rang this morning to ask about my bag. It was still in Miami! I rang 10 hours later today to ask where my bag is, still in Miami! We had 2 days to spend in Lima.

After 2 hours of waiting to receive new boarding passes everyone finally boarded a new air craft that would take us instead. Once everyone was seated they immediately told us that there were glitches and we had to exit the plane and that there would be no new flights until the morning. At this point we had now missed an entire day in Venice, lost all of our money spent on hotels and tours in Venice. We have a friend that is there alone waiting for us now for days. After they made us exit the plane at 2am we spent over 3 hours talking with managers and attendants to find a new plane to Venice because at this point if we boarded the morning connecting plane through London we would miss the plane to Venice and the following plane to Venice would make us miss another day, which at that point we were supposed to be going to Florence. During the duration of time we spent after being exited from the plane, they put us on a completely different flight out of LaGuardia and promised that our bags would be moved from JFK to LaGuardia. As we just showed up to pick up our bags we have been told that in fact the bags were never taken off of the plane and are now in London.

American Airlines,8,Mike Palmer,11th July 2016,"Verified Review | Toronto to Phoenix via Chicago (outbound) and Charlotte (inbound). A bit of a mixed bag to be honest. For $430 CAD extra, I was able to upgrade from Economy to Business for the shorter legs and First Class to/from Phoenix. Unfortunately, a month before departure the Toronto to Chicago leg was changed to a smaller aircraft with no business class. No apology or compensation and not even a free alcoholic drink on the plane. Easy check-in, slow security (as always - Pearson being possibly the worst airport for security lines in N America) and an ok lounge with one free drink. Late boarding and departing on a small canadian regional jet with possibly the most disinterested crew member ever. He was just not interested, barely raised a smile, clearly bored and did the minimum required. On time arrival into O'Hare and on time boarding and departure on an A321 to Phoenix. Seat was ok, IFE on my ipad was average but no free wifi (hardly first class service). Slow service on boarding with a long wait for a drink. After departure, hot towel, menu, drink and meal service with wine. Poor quality dinner of steak (overcooked) and gloopy polenta) There was no bread available due to it not being loaded (on a sunday). Surely operating an airline is a 7 day a week business. The saving grace was the Purser who served the cabin well but by herself (and therefore slow). A second drink was offered and service was generally good. The A321 return trip to Charlotte was similar, an ok lounge at Phoenix with some good snacks and a free drink, on time departure, but again slow service on boarding. The meal bizarrely was a salad to start following by a prawn salad with plenty of booze. Again, the purser provided singular but excellent service to the cabin and was omni present and friendly. Charlotte to Toronto was with Eagle on an E175 which on time. Surly crew who offered snacks and one drink. (A second was given on request). Interestingly for me, other experiences with another major US carrier had excellent crew on the farmed out flights to sub contractors, and awful mainline service. With American it was the reverse - much better service with the mainline crew on the A321 and poor and miserable service on the feeder carriers. Was it worth the $430 return for the upgrade (at the time of booking) - just about. American were underwhelming - nothing particualy bad, but definately not first class service.",Boeing 757,Business,Business Class,YYZ to PHX via ORD/CLT,June 2016,4,4,2,1,2,4,no
American Airlines,4,D Gallan,10th July 2016,"Verified Review | Flight from Dallas to Seoul Incheon was atrocious. After arriving from Amarillo I found out that my flight to Seoul would be delayed 2 hours, meaning that I would miss my last connection flight to Jakarta. When asking the ground service about why the delay, they just rudely told me, ""Maintenance. That's all I know."" They also gave off a tone that seemed as if they hated their job. On top of this, during the actual flight that the delay was only for getting another plane ready. The old cabin sure added to the experience. The IFE was messed up, so Economy class was stuck watching Disney channel shows on repeat for the 13 hour flight. I also recall a cockroach crawling into my seat, but I wasn't surprised, so I didn't do anything about it.

American Airlines,5,David Bielli,10th July 2016,"Verified Review | American Airlines is using a great hard product, on par or above standard. I get upgraded most of the time, so I feel slightly guilty writing this review. However flying London Heathrow - Los Angeles every month, the service seems to be of a higher standard. Los Angeles - Sydney was the same aircraft, but no bar food. Flight attendants were tired on both legs of the trip. They were unpleasant and when asking for something, it was evidently a hassle. Bar - which 777-300ER on AA is now known for has no food option except a few apples and wine. Really? This is their selling point. I often appreciate not having to bother the crew and getting snacks myself. No mid-flight snacks are offered, no water run or anything. Crew just sit in the rest area playing on their ipads or reading books. When asked if I could get a wine or something I was met with ""You seem to be up the whole time."" As if to say - don't bother us and go to bed. Overall really disappointed with the service. I should fly QF again I guess after this. Their seat is nowhere as comfortable, but food is amazing and soft product/service is excellent.

American Airlines,3,B Gordon,9th July 2016,"Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Brussels to Philadelphia. The international business class product on this flight was poor and reminiscent of what you would expect in 2001. Old seats with only a partial recline (nowhere near flat!). Similar to what you see in an economy plus cabin. No in-seat entertainment system. Instead each business class passenger provided with Samsung tablet and headphones. Image quality OK. Selection of movies poor. Also entertainment system requires the only outlet in the seat. Seat tray table is too small for meal and tablet and requiring you to stow tablet during meal service on balance it on your knee. No wi-Fi in cabin. Food quality was poor. The filet steak I was served was over cooked to the point that I could not eat it. Appetizer was a tomato salad followed by a Caesar salad and a steak or fish entree and small slice of cake. Two salads. Obviously not much thought given to the menu. Cabin staff were friendly but not overly helpful. Glasses not refilled. Water bottles left on armrests without being cleared. Amenity kit was also very poor. Toothbrush, eye mask, ear plugs and some free samples from Bigelowe. Again it reminded me of an economy class product.

American Airlines,1,S Wilson,8th July 2016,"Verified Review | I would never fly American Airlines again. I planned a short weekend trip to visit my husband working in South Carolina. My flight was scheduled to leave Hartford at 1.00 pm on July 1st. We boarded on time and immediately started backing away from the gate. We then stopped and sat in place for 15 minutes and eventually returned to gate before sitting another 20 minutes. we were then told there were computer related issues and maintenance needed to be called. Apparently maintenance isn't stationed at the airport and was 30 minutes out. We were asked to deboard and wait and see. I had a 4.20 connector flight in Charlotte that was missed. The AA employees would not reschedule connections until they knew the status of the current flight. At 2.30 I received a call from AA with a new 6.20 connection time. Still no word on the current flight. At 3.00 we were told plane was fixed and reboarded. 30 minutes later we were still sitting at the gate. We were then told Charlotte airspace was closed and we needed to wait for reroute. We finally backed from gate at 3.40 and given permission to fly. At 3.50 we were then ""grounded"" for supposed weather. We sat on runway for another 30 minutes, and finally took off at 4.20. While on plane I asked the stewardess about making the 6.20 connection flight and was told she had no idea and couldn't find anything out. We landed in Charlotte at exactly 6.04. We landed at B gate. My connection was in E concourse. I sprinted the 1/2 mile to the gate and arrived at 6.15 for 6:20 flight. Plane was still there, doors still open. I was told I couldn't get on plane. I explained my flight was delayed 3 hours. I was rudely told I couldn't get on the plane and told to ""go around corner to reschedule"". I arrived at desk at 6.24 to rebook my connection. The attendant looked at his watch and asked why I didn't get on this plane. The next flight out was 5 hours later. I ended up requesting to fly to another airport having my husband drive 2 hours to pick me up. Flight home July 4: No problem from Myrtle Beach to Charlotte. Flight out of Charlotte scheduled for 8.20 pm to Hartford. Walked to gate to confirm location. Went to eat and came back to get to find gate was moved back to D concourse. Time also delayed 30 minutes. Time kept getting pushed back. A plane arrived and deboarded and were told we had to wait for service. At 9.00 we were told the plane was not cleared to fly. After 15 minutes we were sent back to B concourse. Boareded a plane there and again sat on plane for 30 minutes at gate awaiting who knows what. Ultimately took off 1.5 hours late. Overall poor customer service, significant delays, and no consideration for passengers who spent a lot of money to fly there airline. I will go back to JetBlue or Southwest for half the price and never experienced a problem with them.

American Airlines,1,R Lennox,7th July 2016,"Verified Review | Flew LaGuardia to Charlotte. Simply, American Airlines are the worst of at least 40 carriers I have flown. Every flight is late but they cook the books so it looks like they leave on time as they have an hour window at least. The staff are cranky and rude and most look well worn. The planes are falling apart and don't expect anything if you complain. AA like to make you angry by reading a script about how sorry they are. Any day that is spent on an AA plane or within a 2 metre radius of an AA staff member is bound to be a bad day for the customer.

The window frames were literally falling off. The bottoms of the luggage containers had smears, showing they hadn't been cleaned in ages. Talk about deferred maintenance, and this was the first class cabin. The flight crew matched the apathy of the maintenance guys, as people boarded they holed up in the galley to chat, and never went through the cabin.

After they made all the passengers board earlier than scheduled because bad weather was approaching, we sat at the gate for 45 minutes because they had some catering issues. Apparently there weren't enough refreshments for all of us. The A/C of the cabin was broken (I assumed) since it was only blowing hot air. The only time that airplane was cool was when we took altitude. The flight crew couldn't care less about the passengers. They took as long as they could to replenish the freezers with the refreshments and to serve the drinks during the flight. They didn't even pick up the trash. After landing, we encountered yet another surprise: we didn't have a gate. I recommend choosing a cheaper airline.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to DFW,July 2016,1,1,1,2,1,1,no

American Airlines,2,S Long,1st July 2016,"Verified Review | American Airlines should be nothing short of embarrassed with their 767 service out of O'Hare International. I have flown Flight 1377 Chicago - Miami three times in the last two months and have had delays of 5 and 4 hours on these flights. Each time, there was no plane waiting at the gate and we were told they 'were doing maintenance at the hangar' and it would be ferried over shortly. Hours later, when they actually presented a 767 at the gate, we had further delays for 'new' onboard maintenance issues. In my last flight in late June, they boarded everyone, then said they had another 'minor' maintenance issue, then 45 minutes later, they deboarded everyone and sent us to a new gate. We had to wait there for yet another 767 to arrive and then once it did and we boarded - guess what - it too had maintenance issues and were further delayed. Final tally - 2 planes and five hours late to Miami, a full day of travel to cover what is a scheduled 2 1/2 hour flight, 8.20am departure arrived 6.00pm. Anyone who was unlucky enough to have connections out of MIA, which many people do, lost a full day of their vacation or business plans. I generally like flying jumbo jets, but if AA cannot properly maintain their 767s, then they clearly should not schedule them. I will no longer book any AA 767 service as I have completely lost confidence in what I had previously regarded as a top airline, to be able to provide anything close to reliable, ""on time"" service.",Boeing 767,Business,Economy Class,ORD to MIA,June 2016,1,4,3,3,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,E Heydinger,1st July 2016,"This was the most annoying and frustrating travel experience I have had. First, my flight from Sydney was delayed 2 hours after passengers were on board because of a faulty valve. This made a 14 hour flight turn into/feel like a 16 hour flight. This then made me miss my connecting flight out of LA. Instead of going straight to Columbus, I was sent to Philly. The flight attendants were rude and complained to the passengers. My final flight to Columbus was then delayed 3 hours. Instead of getting home at 5.20 pm like originally planned, I didn't get home until 1.01 am. To top it off, I had paid for a window seat on two of the planes, and was denied both this seat option and a reimbursement for it. When talking to customer service about it, the lady was texting while talking to me and refused to help me. I will never fly American again.

American Airlines,2,C Christiansen,30th June 2016,"Verified Review | Grenada to Charlotte via Miami with American Airlines. We sat for 3.5 hours on the plane in Miami awaiting take-off. The oil was low, so we waited 2.5 hours for maintenance to come, then we needed more fuel and then we had to wait on the ground crew. Finally they required all passengers to get off and find other flights. This entire ordeal caused many people to miss connecting flights, all of which could've been avoided from the start. AA did not offer any extra perks for this inconvenience - not even a drink service while sitting on the plane for 3.5 hours. Highly disappointed. They also could've had us get off earlier so we could possibly find earlier flights. One member of staff was set to reschedule 100+ flights for everyone on the plane.

This was my first time flying any American airline and I had no expectations whatsoever. However, this flight was one of the best short-haul flights I've ever been on. Push back in Boston was on-time. Service was on par with a lot of other airlines, or even better. Seat width was more than the rumoured sardine can and seat pitch was generous for a narrow body plane. Slimline seats didn't bother me much; it was pretty comfortable. Pretzel and beverages were served, which is awesome as some other airlines charge these. Cabin crew generous and enthusiastic as they made sure everyone got the beverages they wanted and offered a second one when asked. Flight circled over Atlantic City for 40 minutes as a result of severe weather hitting Reagan Airport. 2 rounds of trash-collecting service offered during the circling. There were connexting passengers onboard and flight attendants offered to check flight status for them. Landed an hour late and got held on the ground for another 30 minutes because of gate issues.

The previous flight has been delayed as well and droves of people ended up waiting for their flights to Philadelphia and Toronto at the same time. The gates ended up getting switched and even then we didn't get to board. After the employees shepherded all of us to the gate we still didn't get to board and they didn't even give us an ETD.

American Airlines,4,F Matthews,25th June 2016,"Verified Review | We just took American first class on a 777 from Dallas Fort Worth to Tokyo Narita. Got a good deal on the flight using miles, but if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is. This class of service should be called enhanced business class, at best. The seats are a bit narrow given the armrests, and hard as bricks. No duvet or other cover to make them into a real bed. They just lie flat. There's also one small pillow. No small light by your seat: if you want a reading light there's only intrusive spotlights in the ceiling panel. 2-together middle seats don't seem to have a partition that rises, which would give you sleeping privacy from a stranger. The bathroom showed a lot of use, with lots of tape and old tape remnants holding in place the toilet. Zero amenities in there, too. There were several lotions in a Cole Hann travel kit by your seat, but not one disposable razor nor shave cream nor comb. Dining was similar. Large portions, but bean counters were again counting. A salad with breakfast had lettuce and two halves of one (yes, one) cherry tomato. Nothing else, not a sliver of a olive nor a shred of onion. And for breakfast forget getting salt and pepper shakers and just rip open a paper packet. There's also no drink cart (a nice way to discourage consumption) and the wines were mostly the sort you find in upscale grocery stores. Stag's Leap is the Chardonnay and one of the reds is Montepulciano d'Abruzzo (not to be confused with the fine reds from Montepulciano in Tuscany). Service was spotty. My wife and I were together but I seemed to get dinner service about 10 minutes before her. And collecting headsets an hour before landing only accommodates the crew. There's nothing wrong with all this, since it is serviceable, just like economy motels. But if you're paying for something special, is it too much to expect something special? And if airlines are competing for higher-priced international travel, could American just loosen its purse-strings by, say, $99 a passenger in first class?

American Airlines,1,Fred Mertz,24th June 2016,"American uses dubious business practices when booking tickets. I booked tickets for a family of 4 weeks before the flight date. There were no available seats at the time except for the upgraded seats at premium prices. I checked daily for a month and no seats opened. I hoped to get seats when we got to the airport. When I checked in online 24 hours pre-flight, I checked seats again. Surprisingly there were 42 empty aisles and window seats now available. American wanted to sell out the middle seats first, then make you pay extra for an upgraded seat rather than make all the empty seats available. We got 2 aisle seats and 2 window seats in the same row. The plane was extremely small and the seats were closer together with less legroom than any of the other 7 carriers I've flown domestically this year - by a lot. When the seat in front of me reclined I had no room to read my iPad without propping it on the top of the seatback in front of me. This made for a very unpleasant flight. Further - all the cabin overhead lights were turned off for the entire flight. It was a red eye but there was no option to turn a light on if you wanted to. Whenever a passenger opened a window blind they were told by the flight crew to close it. This was supposedly to allow people to sleep (because nobody sleeps on day flights obviously) but in effect it minimized the work the cabin crew had to do since everyone was relegated to darkness and had little reason to ask for anything from them. The worst airline and the worst flight I've ever taken is an impressive one-two punch. Avoid American at all costs.

We actually queued for 1.5 hours to resolve the issue. In total 2.5 hours to check 4 bags was ridiculous and the staff who were obvioulsy under pressure and disgruntled were very unhelpful. A lack of information all round meant that people were missing flights through no fault of their own.

I was surrounded by self-service kiosks that would not address my issue. The line was incredibly long. An employee told me to go outside to the curb and use the curbside service to check in. I approached the employee and asked if he could check us in. He could not give me a direct answer. He had a terrible attitude and was condescending and rude. When he finally looked up the reservation he said he could not check us in because there was a problem. We went back to the line and started over again. Finally at the counter we got checked in. On the plane things didn't get any better. The service was so bad. The passenger next to me was traveling with a young child seated across the aisle. We moved around so the child could be sitting with one of his parents. The passenger asked if he could have 2 tiny snacks. The flight attendant adamantly refused stating only 1 was allowed. The passenger on my right asked the attendant if she could take her cup of water away. The attendant said - ""I can't do that right now"" and never returned. Granted these are minor issues but the attitude of every single employee was so rude. This is a service industry. There are so many choices. This was by far the worst choice I have made.

My flight home to Ottawa they had us wait 2 hours well they tried to fix the door of the plane. After that amount of time they game up and got us to another plane. This new plane had a faulty cockpit seat so now we're blessed with another 2 hour wait. Could have been home 2 hours ago now. Great service!,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PHL to YOW,June 2016,1,3,2,,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,L Dayton,17th June 2016,"Verified Review | We booked a vacation via Travelocity in early March for this June. About three weeks later, we get an email saying that our flight has been changed to leave three hours and a half hours earlier, creating a 4 hour layover in Dallas before heading to our real destination of Cozumel. They also changed our return flight to arrive at a completely different airport on the opposite side of the city (about an hour away). This flight also included more layover time. I tried to check in online the night before our flight and checked my bags. I wanted to make sure that we could get in and on the plane quickly and easily. This is the best way to travel through any other airlines I've been on. Not so with American Airlines. It was upon checking in and checking my bags and feeling this great relief that a few minutes later I get the dreaded email - they changed our flight again, just hours before our flight. This time they added another 2 hours layover in Dallas making it a 6 hour layover and it's leaving two hours earlier. We were already booked on a dawn flight. Please keep in mind that flying directly to Cozumel from Houston is only 2 hours total. Since we are flying this airline, we are flying first to a more northern location to wait more than half a day and then back south to our final destination. We arrive at the airport without any sleep because they didn't tell us until 9 pm that they were changing our flight to 5:10 AM. The airport is an hour from our house and this is an international flight, so we had to leave our house by 2 am to get there on time for customs. We actually decided to leave even earlier since we couldn't sleep anyway and got to the airport by 2:30 AM. This is two hours and forty minutes before our flight and there is no one at the ticketing booth. In fact, they had a long line and all the passengers were worried about missing their flights. No one came to the booth until just past 3 am and still took on average 25 minutes for each group of travelers. We didn't get to security until about 50 minutes before our flight and they almost didn't let us on. In fact, one of the security ladies chewed me out because I was feeling antsy and worried about making my flight. She barked that I should have gotten to to the airport well before my flight. I was. It was American Airlines fault for not being at their ticketing booth on time, nor having enough agents to check in their passengers. They are the ones who moved our flight to the middle of the night without our permission, and without any options to change this. It's not our fault they don't have staff to deal with these changes they inflict on their clients. I am actually on the plane and I am going to try to move past how upsetting this whole experience is and that I will waste a full day of my vacation without any sleep and stuck in an airport north of my destination and departing city. The only thing that gives me peace of mind in all of this is that there are other options/airlines in the future because I will never fly with them again after my return flight, which I pray they don't screw up too. We leave tomorrow afternoon for home on this airline. All of this and they charged us baggage fees when I originally checked in online and then charged again when we checked in at the airport because American Airlines had to modify our return flight. They have yet to reimburse for the duplicate charges.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HOU to CZM via DFW,June 2016,2,1,,,1,1,no
American Airlines,9,David Graubard,16th June 2016,"Chicago to San Diego with American Airlines (AA2204) in First Class. Friendly bag-check at the counter - typical overload at TSA precheck. Boarding was on-time and a friendly welcome by the gate agent. Smiles from the flight attendants when getting on the plane - and I watched and they were that way with all the passengers. On-time take off and 3:40 min flying time. Served drinks and nuts, a nice lunch with chicken-breast and salad, dessert and veggies. Pretty tasty. The inflight entertainment was overhead screens with some generic movie and NBC shows - not the best but most people were using wifi or their own devices. Pilots were very communicative and kept us abreast of the journey. Hard landing in San Diego but arrived 15 minutes early and bags out in average time.

American Airlines,1,C Johnson,16th June 2016,"Seattle to Madison via Dallas with American Airlines. Another horrible experience plagued by last minute flight cancelation, rebooking mistakes by the airline, and incompetent customer service. Luckily after hours on the phone and a trip to the airport American finally followed through on rebooking me to a United flight. Unfortunately I was not so lucky on my return. For that leg I had to fly American. It began with delay after delay, enough to make me miss my connection and be told I would be stranded in Dallas until the following day, no explanation given and staff showed no interest. Finally landed in Dallas after an hour delay to find there is no plane for my connecting flight anyway. Constant gate changes and finally after a 3 hour wait we departed on a dirty plane with damaged seats. We finally landed at 1am and were forced to walk across the tarmac (no jet bridge) in the dark to find our own luggage. I have had many bad experiences with this airline but this is it, I'm done.

They did book me for 7:00am fight with a seat 9c. When I got to the airport with my boarding pass on hand and the seat printed on there, they told me no seat available for me.

Since the flight left from the old US Airways terminal in Boston the Admirals lounge was an old US Airways lounge, pleasant, but not overly comfortable. On board staff very pleasant and attentive. A brief stay at the Admirals Club (again, old US Airways) lounge in Charlotte with only oatmeal and breads provided. The flight to St Louis was on a new A319. I will admit that after reading other reviews of that plane I was a bit dubious but in fact found the small (8 seat) first class cabin quite comfortable. Again, no catering except cookies and treats, the the wonderful flight attendant was very attentive and liberal with the drinks.

This was right after the AA-US merger, so I expected worse-than-normal service. However, the flight and experience went surprisingly well. Ticket was only 89 dollars, cheap compared to JetBlue, the only other airline providing Bradley service. There was no delay, and the service was quick at the airport. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the A319 was wearing the Pacific Southern ""smile"" heritage livery. While on the plane, I was surprised to find that the interior was not yet retrofitted, meaning the seats were not as comfortable as advertised, as well as temporarily nonfunctional power plugs. I had a decent amount of legroom, even being 6'2"", and although the journey was barely over one and a half hours, free soft drinks and pretzels.

I purposely booked a red eye that would get me in at 10 am and just got a notice saying it was changes to a 6am flight getting in late in the afternoon. Now my friend and I have paid and there's nothing we can do about it. You used to be able to go through Phoenix and have a short layover on the way down, now most flights are through LA or Dallas and have two stops instead of one.

I said I didn't want to check it, but they did it any way because it 'didn't fit the size requirements'. However it fit in my departure flight.

American Airlines,1,Rich Pagliaro,3rd June 2016,"Back in January, I booked a direct flight from JAX (Jacksonville, FL) to ORD (O'Hare-Chicago, IL) through Expedia. My family and I were returning home from my niece's graduation and my son had school the following day. The flight number was 4266 and it was scheduled to leave JAX at 5.20pm and arrive at ORD at 7.09pm. About a month later Expedia called and stated that American had dropped that flight and we would need to reschedule. The only available flights that would get us home at a decent hour was to go from JAX to CLT (Charlotte, NC) at 4.54pm-6.15pm and then CLT to ORD at 7.05-9.14pm. Certainly not what I wanted, but better than nothing. This was all for a flight on May 23rd, 2016. We arrived at the airport about 2.30pm and proceeded to our gate. So much for the long security line. Sometime after that, we received an alert from Expedia that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. About 5 minutes later, Expedia alerted us that our flight was now an hour late. Still nothing from American even though they had my email, phone number and I had the American Airline app on my phone all setup for alerts. About 5 minutes after the second Expedia alert American finally sent an alert via phone call that our flight was 30 minutes late. That was the only notice we received from American outside of the announcements at the gate that did not start until later. I knew we would miss our connecting flight so I went to the gate to inquire about a later flight from CLT to ORD. I was informed that they automatically pushed us back to the 10.35 flight from CLT to ORD. Nice to have a seat but where was the notification? Not to mention that the flight was not schedule to land at ORD until 11.44pm. A little late for my son to be out on a school night. I was also told by the person working the gate that my original direct flight was being put back on the schedule in June. Very nice of her to point that out, especially when it didn't help me at the time. Or maybe I could have just stayed at the airport another few weeks. Our flight out of JAX ended up 2 1/2 hours late giving us enough time to get to the gate in CLT with about 15 minutes to spare. Thank goodness we had carry-ons only. Our flight to ORD was slightly delayed but not too bad. The flight attendant forgot to offer my wife and I our complimentary beverage during service. I had to ask her for a drink and she seemed put off that I did so. I called customer service to complain as I had paid a premium originally for a direct flight, was bumped to a cheaper flight and was now bumped again to an even cheaper flight. They said they could not help me and I needed to send an email to customer relations. So I did explaining exactly what happened and how I was now also going to need to spend money on a meal at the airport that I did not plan to do. And we all know those are not cheap. American Airlines response to me was that services were provided.

Horrible airline to fly with - they're on a par with Ryanair in terms of space in the seat, not ideal for flying beyond 2 or 3 hours.

They didn't have enough of both meals to cover everyone so by the time they got to me the only option I had was pasta, which I can't eat. On the whole, the JFK staff were not nice but the American Airlines staff were very rude to everyone, rolling their eyes and moaning to each other loudly about passengers. It was disgraceful behaviour. Our flight was fully boarded on time when we got an announcement saying the essential engine checks had started late so we'd be leaving 'in about half an hour'.

I'm currently sitting at Charlotte Airport, having faced a flight that was delayed yesterday afternoon due to poor weather in the area. Though things looked clear down below, we circled for an hour and a half before being diverted to Greensboro to wait out the storm. From there, however, we were delayed another two hours waiting on fuel and gate accessibility and just general disorder in an airport clearly ill equipped to deal with the diversion. By the time we made it back to Charlotte, there were too many planes there to get anyone who was even close to making their connection into the airport - at this point what was meant to be a 2 hour flight had taken 5.5 hours. Stood in a never-ending line waiting for rude customer service and spent the night sleeping on Reagan-era chairs. The next morning we were treated like second class citizens, shuttled from gate to gate waiting on standby flights like we were looking for a handout and hadn't paid a hefty price to book in the first place. It's one thing to have weather impact the flight experience; that's no one's fault.

I had the chicken. and it was good as far as airline food goes. The bread, cheese, salad and brownie that went along with it were also good. A nicely varied meal. Drinks, including beer and wine were complimentary. Unfortunately all they had for beer was Budweiser but what else can you expect from AA? This was a good crew. No fake smiles - they were just regular people treating me like a regular person. Efficient, and I felt completely safe with them. Entertainment was great. Screens were big enough, and the picture quality was good. Good selection of movies, from new blockbusters to old classics. The complimentary earbuds were actually good, considering they were free.

American Airlines,1,E Gammin,29th May 2016,"Verified Review | I fly very regularly within the US for business and almost always use Alaska. This time I had to opt out with flying American Airlines on the way back to Seattle from Philadelphia and it was the worst travel experience I have had in years. In Philadelphia: the flight was overbooked. The plane was old, but my seats were okay because I paid extra for preferred seats and sat in the front area. Once onboard, it turned out that there was an issue with their A/C. At first we were told it would take a ""few minutes"", 15-20 min later, this was extended to ""30 min, at best"". After over an hour we were told this may take up to 2 hours and another 10 mins later finally asked to deplane. I had a connecting flight in Chicago following a layover of just over 2 hours - which meant that the connection was no more. After talking to the gate agent I was put on a new connection, from Philly to Charlotte and then to Seattle. Of course, my careful seat selection that I did during booking was gone. The plane I then got onto was old, seats old and cramped so tightly together I couldn't even sit straight. I could not reach anywhere once the table was unfolded. I sat in the very back, center seat, all of which was the opposite of what I had paid money for so that I would not have to endure it. Suffice to say: this flight again was delayed, over half an hour. Finally in Charlotte, off to the next flight: pretty much the same thing, except that this one at least had wifi. However, since American Airlines does like to overbook their flights they now collected my carry on because all overheads were full, although I told them I was already late and needed to run once we arrived in Seattle. To no avail, customers needs don't matter. And of course it left delayed. We landed at 8.42 and the baggage claim carousel started running at 9.21 - nearly 40 minutes.

I did not get on the earlier flights because so many others were already on the standby list and the 11.30 was nearly an hour late. I had to check my bag at the gate (not for gate pickup though) because, even though I am a relatively frequent flyer, had been delayed 5 hours, I was given last boarding priority.

But when I was about to leave home, their robot called me and said my flight was delayed and they will have to reschedule me to tomorrow's flight. I called back to their toll free number, they just transferred me from one person to another person, and no one could really help. The most ridiculous thing is that I checked my flight status online, it was only 10 min late. I would not affect my connection at all. I called back again, they said they don't know if it will be more delayed and I will not be able to make it to the flight to UK. So I said, I want to canceled the tickets. They said, this number can only rebook your ticket. If you needed to cancel the ticket, you need to talk to ticket department. The ticket department transferred me to vacation department. No one can solve my problem. They just want the money from my pocket. I said I want to file a complaint, they said they don't have a number for complaints, I can only email! I said I want to talk to someone for refund, again, I can only email! And I just checked my flight status. It was on time. So they just rebooked me for no reason.

American Airlines staff were very low energy in some instances, even rude.

When I said I didn't see one in the seat pocket, he said ""look again and get back to me"" and then left - I didn't see him again for the rest of the flight. The woman serving drinks was noticeably annoyed that I asked for coffee and orange juice. The seats were uncomfortable, the whole thing was pretty awful.

American Airlines,1,Lori Edelman,22nd May 2016,"Saint Martin to Philadelphia with American Airlines. I am 27 years old and my mother is 62. In all our years of travel neither of us had ever experienced anything like our flight out of Saint Martin yesterday. We booked a direct flight that left at 2:40PM and was to land in Philadelphia at 7:13PM. When we boarded the plane we were told we would arrive in Philadelphia early and were very pleased by this news. However, after a short time the pilot told us that there was something wrong with the plane. ""Something"" with no further detail as to what was wrong or how long it would take to repair. After 2 hours of waiting in the plane, we were told that the plane was repaired and would be able to fly. The pilot informed us however that due to ""legal issues"" we would not be able to fly to Philadelphia as planned, which was an estimated 4 hours and 35 minutes, instead we would be flying to Miami a 3 hour and 15 minute flight. We were not told anything other than that. We were then given the option to leave the plane but were told we would not be provided a room. About 40 minutes later we took off for Miami. We landed in Miami and waited on the tarmac for over an hour. Were told that we would be greeted by individuals who would tell us where to go and would take us step by step through customs and our return to the 10:30 flight from Miami to PHL. There was no one there to greet us when we arrived and no one to direct us through customs and security. We went through customs and were required to go through TSA security, despite not leaving the airport or having time to purchase anything. Once we arrived at our flight we were delayed in boarding and did not take off until after 11:30. We arrived in Philadelphia at around 2:00 and there was no one from AA to greet us or speak to. We waited, as a group, for our luggage for over 45 minutes before it began to come out. I am extremely disappointed with how disorganized and unapologetic this airline was.

I have a small carry on luggage that I have had for 10 years and have only had to check it once because of weight not for size. Today I had my liquids bag in the front pocket which was making it bulge a bit and when getting ready to board was told it would not fit in the overhead bin I would have to check it. I tried to ask the agent if I could put my liquids bag in the main compartment and they said that it still wouldn't meet the size requirements, that I would have to check it. I showed them that it would fit but they still forced me to check my bag. The flight itself was average, they don't have individual seat TV screens so you were forced to watch poor movies and re-runs of NBC shows such as Chicago Fire, The Tonight Show etc with a ton of commercials which was very bad for a 7 hour flight.

The entire crew felt like they were being put out of their way in all their duties. It was a 5 hour plus flight and there was not even a small bag of chips provided. The inservice video was not working from my seat with nothing that could be done. On the return flight a week later, another lazy crew was on board. At one point I went to use the lavatory at the rear of the plane and both crew members were sitting in their seats in the last row of the plane talking. In front of the galley was a mother and young daughter who were being shouted at by one of the crew because they had helped themselves to something in the galley.

Some planes were held so people could make the connection, ours was not with no reason given. We we got on the last American flight out that night only because a nice guy working for the Phoenix airport had a motorized cart and he knew of the last American flight out of there that night and raced us over to it. American gate agent yelled at us as if it were our fault to be arriving late. We incurred a $100 taxi fare because the last plane was to San Francisco instead of Oakland. On JFK to Phoenix leg, multiple passengers and children were allowed to ignore the captain's message about returning to seats and strapping in. As a result aisle remained clogged, children climbing over seats unattended. The chaotic scene was a safety hazard. Flight attendants spent much time in their jump seats curtained off while they talked and laughed. Ran out of food and drinks except warm water and orange juice.

American Airlines,5,N Roper,23rd April 2016,"Verified Review | Seattle to Buenos Aires via Dallas Ft Worth. I fly regularly to Argentina from the US. I purchase First Class tickets, typically in the region of $5-6000 USD for a return trip. I have to say that AA First Class is not a patch on other international carriers. My most recent trip, the hard product was okay, the seat was comfortable and that was about it. The AVOD system is old, slow, low resolution with a tiny screen. The choice of movies is very limited. Even bearing that in mind, this can be made up for in service. I found the flight crew to be indifferent, the service below average and the attitude seemed to be we were a constant inconvenience preventing them from being able to get back to the socializing at the front of the cabin. I am a very, very low maintenance flyer, but I found even the basics were missed. On the outbound leg, I wasn't even offered a drink at boarding! This is in International First Class. Food choices weren't available from the menu (I was in 2J) and I get the distinct impression that most people on the flight were on FF upgrades as opposed to paying pax. On the return flight, an AA employee (non flight crew) was sitting across from me - he was attentively taken care of, chatted to, given menus/drinks/turn down etc. The Airline is in trouble when it takes care of employees over premium passengers paying thousands of dollars for a seat. Aircraft is getting really old, this was a B777-200, and the interior was probably late 90's or early 2000's. Other than the large seats, everything was to a lower fit, finish and equipment level than an Alaska B737 in economy! There is not excuse for this, in fact, the AA A320 on the connecting flight to Seattle was way better with USB ports, power and a really nice big hi res AVOD system. Delta flies old airplanes too, but their interiors are bang up to date. There was not even a standard 110V power outlet - in First Class! It's hard to be a repeat customer, AA has been good in the past, but they are now firmly in the United Airlines category for me, they don't seem to be too bothered about earning my dollars.

American Airlines,1,J Dlabaja,19th April 2016,"Verified Review | I had the absolute worst experience out of the other 3 carriers I have flown before. American Airlines customer service is almost non existent and they just rip you off and not care. I had a connecting flight in Miami, FL that they scheduled for me, which boarding time was at 8:59 pm and departing time was 9:29 pm. My first flight to Miami landed on time at 9 pm, by the time I was actually off the plane (I pack very light and had one small backpack) it was about 9:07. I ran to my connecting flights gate to make sure I got there in time to check in and board to return home. When I approached the gate (at 9:15), the gate worker asked aloud if anyone was next and after I said that I was on the flight he responded very rudely ""too late, go rebook at the rebooking station"" and as he said that he printed out a boarding pass and handed it to a girl who was on stand by with her boy friend, also on stand by. So he basically did not want to undo what he had just done, which was give my seat away when I got there when I was supposed to be. The lady at the rebooking station then tried to charge me to rebook for something that was not my fault! I was stuck in Miami for over 12 hours, missed my shift at work and my classes. After contacting customer relations about the situation, they told me that it was my fault because I did not get to the gate to check in 30 minutes prior (which would have to have been 8:59 pm, when my first flight was landing). Not only that, but not once did I hear them paging me over head to ""recheck"" or for their last call. After not getting a response back for weeks I decided to call again, the customer service rep then told me that the connecting flight that they had scheduled was in reality not a legal connection because it was set to depart less than 30 minutes after I arrived, that they cannot be less than 45 minutes. Which if that were the case, I would have gotten there in their ""30 minutes policy"" time frame. After sending yet another email asking to be contacted by a superior by phone, I received another email saying that there is nothing they can do.

American Airlines,1,Y Zhang,18th April 2016,"Verified Review | I am baffled at how unprofessional the entire American Airlines staff was at LAX. I was dropping off my parents at LAX We arrived at the airport around 10:30. We went in and used the check-in kiosk (but the kiosk said our confirmation number was incorrect) We decided to wait in line. Once we noticed that the kiosk assistance was free, my father asked for help but was surprised to receive a rude response from the staff member who rolled their eyes and proceeded to walk away. At that time we decided to continue to wait in line to speak with the check-in staff. My father even helped a single mother who was next in line who was clearly having difficulties with putting her luggage on the scale. We noticed that no one from the staff was helping her and seeing that she an infant strapped to the front he decided to step in. At this this point it was 10:50pm and we were getting anxious about missing our flight and going through security. So I took the initiative to walk up patiently to the desk. and was told final boarding was completed and that no other passengers were able to board. However after calling corporate head quarters, once we got home, we learn that final boarding time was actually 15 min prior to the flight time. The desk person told me to rush to ticketing to see if there was a connecting flight to get to our airport in Orlando. When we got to ticketing, we noticed that there were barely anyone in line, but the staff had no urgency or professionalism toward the waiting passengers/customers that needed help. There were only two customers in front of me. This is ridiculous in terms of manpower to customers, as there were 6 American Airlines staff members. I waited 15 minutes in line patiently. During this time, I saw an AA staff member who was easily identifiable. She just finished up with a customer. I waited a few minutes to wait for her to flag the next customer. She didn’t flag the next person (me), but instead was talking casually to the other staff members. So I walked up and waited to be addressed since she was talking. I did not say a single word or interrupt. She looked up at me and said in the most rude condescending disrespectful tone, that they weren’t ready. So I said back, “excuse me I didn’t even say anything to you”. Four other staff members who were free proceeded to talk and chat amongst each other. At this time, there were 7 parties behind us who needed assistance. I was finally helped around 11:10.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to MCO,April 2016,,,,,1,1,no
American Airlines,4,S Freeman,17th April 2016,"Verified Review | When we checked in, we only recieved our boarding passes from Honolulu to Dallas. Seat on the Boeing 767 was poor, I am a skinny person, and the seat and legroom was horrible for a 7 hour flight. The food was ok, I had a salad for 12 bucks. When we landed in Dallas, we tried to go to a kiosk in the airside, where you can print a boarding pass you didn't recieve at check-in, or so it said. We weren't able to print the boarding pass because American and US Airways were still in the process of merging, but both planes were painted in the American Airlines livery. When we went to the gate, luckily DFW Airport has the sky train, that's a plus, the gate agent refused to give us our boarding pass, so I had to show him the confirmation e-mail. We were the last passengers onboard, there was no overhead baggage space, so we had to go back to the gate agent to have our bags gate checked to Philly. Luckily, I slept throughout this entire flight. Landed in Philly, everything was ok, got our checked bags, and left.

American Airlines,2,J Hunt,16th April 2016,"Salt Lake City to Knoxville via Chicago with American Airlines. Half way through boarding the first flight everyone was removed from the plane. It took the agent 25 minutes to tell the passengers any information as to what was going on. Mechanical problems. We sat for at least an hour before anything else was said. We were told to come to the counter and schedule another flight if we wanted. After standing in line for 45 min we were then handed a 1 800 number to call to reschedule. When I was near completed doing this they said the flight was canceled, we would have to go collect our luggage at the baggage claim, and go through the ticket counter to then get our new boarding passes. The 1800 agent had me scheduled, but it automatically canceled that one and scheduled me on another flight - 1 hour from then. I rushed to collect my bags and at the ticket counter the agent was not concerned about my troubles. The new schedule delayed my arrival by a day and I would have to stay in Chicago over night after arriving at 11 pm. When I asked she told me she didn't see where 'they' were giving any vouchers for food or overnight stay. Also, despite the long security line she wouldn't get me a 'prescreen' pass to get through security quicker. She said 'you have plenty of time.' Well, I did make it, with 3 minutes to spare. She was so right. I was routed through Dallas where I asked the agent there if I would be given a food and/or overnight voucher. She said I would have to check in Chicago, she couldn't help me. Upon arrival in Chicago the airport was almost empty except for a gate where they were about to load a plane. There were 4 agents standing at the counter talking (ie. doing nothing), so I asked one what I needed to do about staying in Chicago and is American Airlines going to give me a voucher. She said 'she was busy having to get ready to load a plane' and gave me another 1800 number to call or I could go down to the service center, which is a collection of phones, but no agents. I decided to consider it a complete loss. It was now almost midnight so I walked to the Airport Hilton, paid for a room, and left the next morning with yet another delay. Since then I have heard similar stories about American. I don't think I will be flying with them again.

They re-routed me which meant not having the 3 hour layover in Phoenix in which I planned to see my brother and his sons. I was not compensated in anyway. When I booked the flight I had to change it and pay $108 but when they mess up my flights there is no compensation. My business in LA concluded earlier than planned and I wanted to get back earlier, they refused to waive a change flight fee for me saying they cannot do it and they told me they do not permit standby either. I took pictures of the disgusting condition of the plane I flew back on - the seat back flaps were peeling away from the seats, it was desheviled and gross. None of the entertainment options or free snacks they boasted about in their in-flight magazine ever occurred.

Most recently, an AA flight canceled due to a crew member not showing up. I was placed on another flight the following day that had additional layovers because that was ""all that was available."" I was not in my home city so the AA agents gave me a voucher for $150 for cab fair/hotel but when I tried to use it, I was told I needed to pay out of pocket and contact AA Customer relations to get reimbursed. There is no phone number for AA Customer Relations (apparently they do not have phones), only email. I never got an email response and was never reimbursed. And, as if that is not frustrating enough, because I was added late to the alternate flight, I was the last to board, we somehow ran out of overhead space (on two separate flights) and they had to check my small (18"" round) carry-on. I pleaded with the flight attendant to let me keep it because it had valuable/fragile gifts in it but she insisted and it broke. I will never fly AA again.

Again I had a Premium Economy seat paying EY fare and it was quite comfortable, again I say thanks to AA for such member benefits.

American Airlines,1,S Mason,13th April 2016,"Verified Review | Terrible round trip flight from Seattle to Atlanta with American Airlines. The seats do not recline back at all despite having a button that is supposed to allow you to do so and all the flight attendants tell you to put your seats in the upright position. The arm rests are so hard, if you are a taller than average person be prepared to have a very uncomfortable flight. You can't stretch your feet out, your knees touch the other person's seat, you will be sitting up straight for the whole flight. Make sure to dress warmly as they like to keep you frozen during the flight as popsicles are less likely to walk around the cabin. They nickel and dime you to the point that it would have been cheaper to go with the more expensive airlines. I have a global entry card which is usually good enough for TSA pre check in most airlines, but you have to pay for that ""convenience"". Want to check your bag? That will be $25. Two bags; $60. Want to pick your seat? $45+ depending on the seat. Want Internet? $6 for 30 minutes. Please note, I chose N/A for food and beverages and inflight entertainment since I didn't use these.

I was disappointed to find that this particular Boeing 767 didn't have any seat back flight entertainment. Just an old and worn out cabin with original interior and seat, possibly that has not changed since it was put into service 20 years ago. The only entertainment was CRT screens in the middle aisles and a choice of music played in a loop from the arm rest, maybe this was acceptable 10 years ago but in 2016 you would expect the airline to provide a modern cabin. In fact the whole cabin was so old and tatty even those in first had to use tablets for entertainment, this is unacceptable when paying passengers expect some modernisation. For such a popular route from Chicago to London you would expect American Airlines to consider using a more modern aircraft, but no they obviously don't care what their customers might think of the airline. They can afford to buy dremaliners and 777's but don't bother updating their current fleet. The food was also pretty poor quality compared wo what I have been offered on BA in the past, but I don't expect fine dining on an economy ticket. The only positive were the nice cabin crew and flight crew, very friendly, nice to talk to and captain offered very useful information throughout the flight.

American Airlines,3,V Lemster,11th April 2016,"Verified Review | New York to Edinburgh with American Airlines. Got to airport (JFK) about 4.5 hours before departure. Decided to use electronic login terminals as we only had cabin baggage. Process was relatively straightforward and two documents were printed, however they did not have seat numbers on them but had instructions to proceed to gate where seat numbers would be allocated. Went through security and straight to gate, needless to say, there was no-one there becasue it was so early. Eventually about 10 minutes before boarding was due to start, one member of staff turned up so I got straight to the desk before anyone else to ensure that my wife and I could sit together on the long flight. I was then told that the flight was overbooked and that I would have to wait. Eventually another member of ground staff came up to the desk about five minutes before boarding was due to start (very harassed). Thankfully my name was called and we were able to get seats, but they were offering people 800 dollars to take another flight. There were many disgruntled people complaining about lack of information. Once boarded, we then had to wait for about an hour as they couldn't get one of the engines started! Actual flight was OK, but seat was very uncomfortable (I thought airline seats were all the same). Cabin crew did all that was required of them, but very disappointed in the ground staff, but maybe that's just the AA way of doing things!

Surprisingly very pleasant experience with American, especially how many horrible stories you hear about US-based airlines. The aircraft was a relatively new Boeing 787, and the J class cabin was a spacious 1-2-1 layout in reverse herringbone. Went onboard and was greeted with warm nuts and welcome drink. There was an amenity kit by Cole Haan, but everything was made in China, even the lotions, which made the product simply feel very cheap and of poor quality. The seat is fully lie flat. It's somewhat comfortable, the only complaint is that when the person next to you moves, for some reason, you can feel it (and I suspect the other person can also feel when I move) The inflight entertainment system was very impressive. Not only was the screen very big, there was an flatscreen display to control the programme from the comfort of your seat. There is also an iPhone-sized control for manipulating your seat and adjusting it to any way you wish, very impressive technology! The meal service was good, and came very eloquently presented.

American Airlines,1,D Cain,8th April 2016,"Verified Review | I will never fly with American Airlines again after the fiasco I experienced 30 Mar. Due to leave Ontario, CA at 1005 am arriving PHX at 1114 am. When I checked in at 0800 flight was “on time.” Cleared security and proceeded to the departure gate. Around 0935 announcement made that flight was delayed and passengers with connecting flight prior to 1230 were to return to ticketing counter. My Atlanta connection was scheduled for 1236 so I stayed at the gate. A second announcement was made some time later and I realized there was no way I could make my connecting flight. There is no customer service available at the gate areas and I had to return to the ticketing counter which meant a second time through security. This certainly did not please me but I went back to the ticketing counter and stood in the line that provided ticket sales/customer service. During my 30 minute wait in line the clerk kept telling the customers they would be much quicker going to the other end of the counter. Finally, when the “other end of the counter” was free I moved over to it. The clerk told me she couldn’t help me and directed me back to the counter I had just moved from. I told her it was time American Airlines got their act together as “he” had just directed me to her counter for service. By then I was incensed but, moved back to the other line yet again. At no time did I hear any explanation for the two delays. By the time I got to the clerk I was not too receptive to her “resolutions.” She could reschedule me for the following day (I had already cleared my hotel and turned in my car); she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Charlotte, Atlanta; she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta. Both flights would get me to Atlanta around 1148 pm. I did ask about transferring to either Southwest or Delta but was told I could only transfer to “partner” airlines. If I wanted to go with another airline I would have to pay to do so. At that time I had no idea there was a bad storm impacting Dallas but I’m sure your staff were well aware of that fact. While not happy, I opted for the Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta flight. Went back through security for a second time and headed for the departure gate. Another announcement stated due to a bad storm in the Dallas area the flight was delayed. This delay meant I would miss the last shuttle from Atlanta. The coup de gras was my boarding passes were stamped for Group 4-----my seat numbers were 23A and 15C. I came to the conclusion that your clerk purposely placed me in the Group 4 boarding sequence to add a little more aggravation----retribution perhaps? I’m 78 years old and have traveled many, many times in the past 58 years both in the States and to other countries. The airlines have merged to the point that they now have a monopoly. Subsequently, they no longer have to be concerned about retaining their customers. They are making billions in profits with the fuel price as low as they are but you continue to gouge the customers at every point - $25 for early boarding, really?

Well, I was travelling First and I am a BA Gold Card holder (Emerald in Oneworld) so I was doubly entitled to check in there. Very off-putting for an employee to do this. Worse was to come. The so-called First class is anything but First class, apart from the seat which was comfortable. No welcome. Pre-departure drinks were not cleared. Moody flight attendants. No hand cream in toilets. No breakfast worth having (only two quiches, the one I had was very bland and soggy). No bread was offered, just sweet cookies. I deliberately did not eat anything in the lounge hoping for a good First class breakfast. If I had brought a McDonald's meal I would have been more satisfied. Entertainment was a table.

American Airlines,6,Garrett Cimms,6th April 2016,"Verified Review | A red-eye flight from Las Vegas to Philadelphia with American Airlines. Flight was fully booked. All overhead storage was full, well before half the plane boarded. Our boarding group wasn't even called yet before they announced storage was full. This did cause boarding to take a lot longer than normal, as many people had to back track to check their bag with the front desk. The front desk continuously announced you could check your bag for free at the desk, due to the storage shortage, but it appeared most who were boarding ignored this. We gladly took them up on it, and dropped off our bags at the desk, well before everyone else finally realized they had no choice. This at least let us board quicker as everyone was now crowding the front desk. Desk crew was friendly enough, I think they were getting a bit annoyed despite multiple announcements that there would be no storage, that people were generally ignoring their calls. We flew economy, so seats were as expected. I'm quite tall, as is my wife, so it can be a bit uncomfortable with the small leg room after an hour or two. Knees not in the seat, but, not enough room to move them at all. So, if you are in the plus 6 foot range, and with a bad knee, can be a bit annoying, but, we realize you get what you pay for. Crew were friendly and pleasant enough, flight was mostly quite as it was leaving Vegas at 11pm and landing in Philly at 6. Napped most of the way, when I could, so nothing really to report. Flight was generally smooth and we arrived earlier than scheduled, so that's always nice. I only had a glass of water during the flight, so can't really comment on food/drink service, too much. I believe the Wifi on this flight however did not work. Disembarking was only troubled by other passengers. A middle-aged man near the back of the plane decided, rather than wait for the rows to ahead to disembark, he would just start pushing his way out, which caused people to get chippy.

Coming back home, I arrived at the airport very early and noticed that no staff were there to give me a boarding pass. I decided to use a machine to check-in and I was concerned when my reservation was not found. Once the staff arrived, I was informed that my flight to Dallas was cancelled due to weather. I researched the weather conditions in Dallas and found out that there were indeed thunderstorms, but they were brief and many other flights were delayed (not cancelled). Since the delay was ""weather"" related, the airline did nothing to help (no food and no hotel) and they repeatedly lied to customers. They had me re-booked on flights that were two days later, but I fought hard (and spent hours) to get onto a LAN flight that got me home just one day late. The cancellation cost me a lot of time and money (for hotels, taxis, and food) and the staff and service on American was atrocious. I truly believe that airlines use weather as a loophole to cancel flights that have light loads (saving them money) without having to take responsibility! The only good thing about the cancellation was that I ended up getting to fly LAN Airlines to Miami. LAN provides more leg room, comfortable seats, delicious meals with wine, and their staff really seem to care about the passengers. American Airlines is a nasty behemoth of an airline and I recommend avoiding them (even if it means paying more for a competitor).",Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGA to UIO via MIA,March 2016,2,1,2,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Nathan Gau,2nd April 2016,"My recent experience flying out of Oakland to Indianapolis via Phoenix has shown that American will stoop to incredible lows when trying to avoid FAA regulations regarding oversold flights. Our flight was oversold, and when they could not find enough people to take their vouchers, they announced a last minute delay. They didn’t follow any procedures for said delay. Their gate agents knew nothing and the flight information wasn’t updated until sometime after I had boarded. Once onboard, we were told the delay was due to a leaky coffee pot. I’m still at a loss as to what safety issues were at stake for this issue. The flight attendant wasn’t much better simply stating, ‘you wouldn’t water on the floor would you?’ Clearly there is a disconnect here, because missing a connecting flight over a little or even potentially a lot of water on the floor isn’t worth it, especially on a holiday weekend where my plans for the following day ended up completely ruined. Myself and probably a dozen other people missed our connecting flights. In my case, I arrived at my gate just as my plane was pushing off. My destination wasn’t a hub, and the people managing this flight couldn’t wait five more minutes to allow myself and the other two passengers who arrived at the same time I did, the courtesy to board. The next flight was four hours later (on a red-eye), and for my inconvenience, I got a meal voucher that would only be able to pay for a fast food dinner. Running through Phoenix, my laptop bag managed to open up causing my laptop to fall out. My experience with AA customer service wasn’t much better. They don’t get back right away, and they refused to escalate this. To this day, I’m still trying to figure out how a leaky coffee pot presents any real safety issue worthy of grounding a flight, and customer service didn’t have a good reason for it either. I was offered a measly 10,000 bonus miles, worth nowhere near what the travel voucher I should have received for essentially being involuntarily bumped. That will get you (if you’re lucky) one third of a domestic ticket, and not at all worth the inconvenience that was forced on me and fellow passengers. At best, this was someone’s incompetence. At worst, this was an unethical way for an airline to save a few thousand dollars. If it has really come to something like this to make a few extra dollars, then perhaps it’s time for their customers to find an airline that respects them a bit more.",,Business,Economy Class,OAK to IND via PHX,March 2016,1,1,,,1,1,no

The day before the flight they moved my wife and I to different seats on the plane, that weren't even close to each other. We had make our reservations 8 months ahead of time, I figured that flights can change last minute, and they must have overlooked this detail. I called them to make them aware of the problem. I sat on hold with them for over an hour, till the representative came back and said they couldn't do anything about it over the phone and I would have to go directly to the airport to fix the problem. But also assured me that there were plenty of seats left and not to worry. I didn't want to take a chance, so I went online to check in and paid an extra fee to upgrade our seat so that I could move them together. When we got to the airport, they had moved our seat again, and they were no longer together again. They told me the plane was full and they couldn't do anything about it. Nor would they refund the fee I paid earlier. I would of made more of a big deal about it, but there was a family of 5 with small children in front of me that they did this same thing to, with seats not near each other.

The crew however were unengaged bordering on rude, no interest shown to the passengers, mechanical, no smiles, one felt that they'd rather be anywhere else but on the plane. Food was quite a disappointment, as well, edible, but resembling canteen fare. IEE were a bright spot, screens large, sharp, HD, with tons of movies and variety of shows.

We left five hours late on March 28th due to heavy winds and rain. When finally on the aircraft it was immaculate. Pre-flight drinks offered and the menu given out. Considering AA now only has eight seats in the 1st class compartment of the Boeing 777-300, the two cabin staff assigned were more than sufficient; friendly and polite despite the harried nature of the boarding. Lunch served after reaching cruising altitude, starter, soup, and salad were very good. I wasn't very happy with the main course, considering the delay I probably should have chosen something other than beef. The flight attendant saw that I hadn't eaten anything she offered me another which was delicious. The inflight entertainment was great with hundreds of choices. The intercontinental WiFi took some adjusting but eventually worked just fine. My connecting flight was delayed for about an hour due to a mechanical part which needed replacing. Again on the short flight to St. Louis the cabin crew was friendly and very helpful with pre-flight offered immediately. Drinks were served promptly at cruising altitude and seconds were offered with a smile. Aside from the weather delay, not a bad experience at all.

That being said, I recently went on an around the world business journey that took me from NY to LA then Hong Kong, London and finally back to NY. The first and last leg were American Airlines the middle two legs were Cathay Pacific. While the AA planes were shiny and new and the business class was very comfortable, the level of service between the two carriers was night and day. It takes flying an airline like Cathay to realize just how much the service lacks at American. On Cathay I was personally greeted, asked if I required anything before takeover (and prior to landing), was given a large, clean, hot towel, had a very attentive flight crew that cared about my comfort and was always there to help and offer anything. On American Airlines I had a crew of people that clearly wanted to be anywhere else. The warm towel was old and cold, the food was thrown at me as if it was a race to finish the meal service, when I asked for another water I was given the cold stare - the team just seemed mad and visibly demonstrated that they think their job sucks. I wish I could say this was a one-off, but I have noticed it more and more on my AA flights. Its sad and makes me not want to keep flying the 50-100K miles I fly each year on AA. Whatever happened to people having pride in their work? The last 6 AA flights I have been on have all had a problem of one sort or another - I notice the pilots having to apologize a lot.

On March 17, 2016 we embarked on a journey of a lifetime. My eldest daughter was to be married in Curacao, a destination wedding. After meticulous planning we arrived at JFK airport to find that our flight would be delayed. In that delay we learned we would miss our connector from Miami to Curacao. After being directed into three different lines, we were told nothing could be done and that we would not get connector flight out to Curacao via Miami till 1130 a.m. the next morning. (Almost 18 hours after our initial connecting time.) Crushed at the news of potentially missing the wedding, airline staff asked why we booked our connector like we did? As if it were our fault! Tears rolling down face I responded by asking ""why the offer a connection under 50 minutes if it can't be honored? Fast forward, we finally board our flight to Miami. Things seem to be going ok until we stay on the runway for 50 minutes. No explanation given. We finally take and arrive in Miami to find we cannot disembark because there is a broken plane in the way. Left with no patience and a $14 food voucher we schlep to our hotel.

Rather than being the exception, this has become the rule. This is an obvious cash grab to try and get people to upgrade to more expensive seats to be able to pick their seats. Make no mistake they hold back seats for elite members that most 'normal' families will not see as options. When I expressed my displeasure at being separated from members of my party they told me I should not expect to have three people seated together.

On none of the flights I was welcomed onboard, neither heard a ""bye"" or ""thanks"" when leaving the aircraft. The best flight was the first, both regarding the seat, the food and the crew. The last flight was absolutely the worst. An old, worn Boeing 777 with terrible seats. Delayed 3 hours because they had to change a part after we already had boarded. The crew was quite miserable, not enough lavatories, the food was so so, the entertaiment choices very limited.

Over the last two months, they have made 5 schedule changes without letting us know of the change. We have to constantly monitor our record to find the changes, and two have required us to rebook different flights in order to make connections. We are still two months out, so I am expecting another 5 changes before we depart. When we call to talk to a representative they are generally nice, but completely unhelpful. Two of them even took to reading me their operations manual as they tried to decide what to do. I am a frequent flyer with other airlines, and have never had a single schedule change.

My trip was uneventful, which in my books is good. No delays, no issues with my bags, and no issues with the flight itself. Originally I was supposed to fly home on Saturday 12th March, but due to extreme flooding in North Louisiana, which is where I flew to, I will not be able to make it to the airport tomorrow. The airport I flew into is about 2 hours away from where I am at and the airport there was not in the extremely affected areas. At first I was told that unless I was flying out of one of the two cities that got hit the worst nothing could be done about my flight, even though the roads to get to the airport I was flying out of were blocked. I spoke to AA customer service and she was able to wave the fees and change my flight anyways, I am now a pleased customer and will be comfortable flying with them again.

American Airlines,1,Andrew Kin,11th March 2016,"Just had a horrible experience - I had a red-eye American Airlines flight to Miami from LAX for an important meeting. The flight was supposed to leave at midnight, and was on a ""new"" plane, according to the captain. Before even taxiing, the airplane began to experience computer issues. Multiple attempts to fix this, including a reboot, rewiring, and many false starts all resulted in nothing. In the end, I got off the plane because there was no way I could make my meeting in Miami in time. The plane ended up taking off around 7:30 am after a 7.5 hour delay. On top of that, American is taking up to 6-8 weeks (according to their timeline) to refund me the seat upgrade I paid for, didn't take accountability for this issue or suggest solutions, and didn't give any miles or more than a half-hearted apology by e-mail.

As we sat quietly on the ground, they eventually told us that the part they needed would be here by 2:00pm. The flight was suppose to leave PHX by 11:30am. As 2pm approached, they told us the mainentance wouldn't be here in time. They found another plane and had us head to that area of the airport. They told us to hurry over because the flight would board by 2:15 pm. 2:30 pm came around and we were still waiting to board and for a pilot to arrive. We boarded the plane at 2:45 pm. 3:10pm comes around and we still haven't moved. The flight attendant comes over the loud speaker and tells us there is another problem. We have now been on the plane for 4.5 hours and during this entire time, not one member of American Airlines staff has apologized for the inconvenience, nor comped anyone's troubles. We are now on the second airplane, while we wait for mainentance, a second time. I have never been on an airline in my life that was so disrespectful to their passengers.

American Airlines business experience was almost laughable on the return journey. The flight out was OK but not anywhere near as good as other airlines. The return journey was abysmal. From surly check in which even my son commented on,to an ancient aircraft and inedible food. We assumed from all the advertising about the newly refitted planes we would enjoy a comfy flight. I checked in online the day before and looked at the seat plan to make sure it was the new configuration which it was. On boarding what a disappointment to find an ancient plane with the old seats and shabby interior. We have experienced these old planes before and our hearts sank. So much for a treat. The stewardess was in such a rush to serve my wife she skipped the nuts and gave her her starter immediately, before she was ready, her plate was whipped away and her entre plonked in its place. We had to laugh because we felt we were in a carry on film. What is it with American Airlines staff? They need some training as something is missing, and their customer service is dire. Sadly they have a monopoly on the Raleigh route. We will consider going another route next time on British Airways who are so much better. One good thing, the plane landed on time. Wake up, American and sample what other airlines are doing.

After telling everyone that repairs would take ""about a half hour"" he then came back and said delays would now be another hour. He let people unboard, which later resulted in further delays. By the time we took off we were two hours behind. Once again there was an unusually long delay between leaving the gate & getting off the ground.

On my recent flight on American Airlines it came to a new low at least as far as entertainment is concerned. The available selection and more so the interface is not something I expected to see on a Boeing 777. The movie selection was minuscule, even compared to carriers such as United. The New release selection comprised a handful of features and most of them weren't even that new. The features are not ""on demand"" they have a cycle and you have to either watch what is in progress or wait for the next feature to start. The food in general is mediocre but since my flight originated in London it is probably better than if I had started my trip in Miami.

I realized after landing in Miami that I had dropped my phone on the plan (Flight 2059). I went to the AA information desk and they told me that the plane was on its way back Charlotte (which seemed like a very quick turn around and I highly doubt that AA is that efficient). I was told that I would be able to retrieve my phone at Charlotte Airport when I return. I did file a lost and found report with AA on their website and got a generated e-mail that stated I would have to contact the airport. A week later when I landed back in Charlotte I went straight to the AA counter in the baggage claim area. I explained about my phone and the first thing out of the girls mouth was that I would need to come back in the morning because her supervisor was not there. I told her that I lived 2 hours away and it was impossible to come back in the morning. She then proceeded to spend the next ten minutes going through the computer system and finally told me that she did not see a phone matching my description. I have called AA at Charlotte Airport and all you get is a recording stating to leave your information and IF the item is found they will call you back. There is no way of talking to a real person. Needless to say it has been almost two weeks and I have yet to hear anything. If AA cannot even return a phone when given the exact information on where and when the phone was lost, I cannot imagine what they do with really expensive items that they retrieve from planes.

The plane was painted in the new livery, but don't let the new exterior deceive you. The interior of the plane was outdated, as the seats were very uncomfortable to sit in and looked like they were from the 1990s. The trays were difficult to fold back into place once you unfolded them, and some even had scratches and ink marks from over the years. The lavatories were showing their age and were disgusting. The only entertainment sources of entertainment you had were magazines, the window, and what you brought on the plane. They had TVs on the ceiling, but they only started playing a movie in the last hour or so of the flight. The cabin crew was the best part of the flight. They came around a few times with beverages and snacks, and they were dedicated to doing their job. There was barely any turbulence, which made the flight very smooth.

The Miami airport was the most miserable travel experience of my life. After spending a wekk at the wonderful W hotel, I was met with rude American Airline agents at every corner - from the bag check in, to security. Angry, rude, completely unprofessional. At bag check in we were met with 90 percent of the kiosks out of order. Then we were yelled at regarding proper protocol for checking bags as if guilty of something. Then without any direction to where our gate was we roamed the enormous airport without any guidance from our baggage check in. Upon arriving at the gate, the airline agent followed the airline consistency of rudeness reprimanding us for showing up only 20 minutes before the flight was departing, which was insane considering we still stood in line for 20 minutes to board the plane. Upon getting on the plane, I greeted the flight attentendant with ""how are you today"", only to be met with a deer in the headlights attitude of why was I even talking to her. Then to end this complete miserable experience, my luggage was lost. The luggage specialist told me the luggage was placed on the next flight rather than ours. We arrived at the airport 2 hours before out flight, I asked her why this had happened. Her response was I have no idea. I then asked if I would received some sort of credit for this inconvenience and my luggage being delivered within 5 days, which she said no we don't do that. The lack of professionalism at every corner was astonishing. I flew Jet blue recently and the flight was bumpy and they credited every passenger 50 dollars, they are a class act. American Airlines seems to have been reduced to a modern Peoples Express. I am sure the CEO gets a handsome salary, but frankly is not doing their job with having such chaos and poor customer service exist at every level through a passengers experience.

The same aircraft continued to PDX after a one-hour stop in PHX, with a complimentary beverage and snacks for sale run. Flight attendants did several rounds to check seat belts, and also to collect trash on both segments. Arrived on time in PDX and my bag was on the carousel reasonably quickly.

American Airlines,1,Meagan Larimer,18th February 2016,"I understand that sometimes flights get delayed or cancelled, it happens. What I do not understand is how a flight can get cancelled the night prior and I do not get notified, I still show up to the airport at 04.30 in the morning only to be told I got rescheduled to the following day at 11.30 am? I was scheduled to depart from Fayetteville, NC with American Airlines - I asked the lady working at the front ticket counter if there were possibly any flights I could make out of Raleigh, which is an hour away. She pretended to look then said there was absolutely nothing and I was stuck with the next day flight. A little while after leaving I decided to call customer service just to be sure, as it turns out there was a flight at 07.30 from Raleigh that I could have made it on to, and been able to make it back home for my college courses. Along with that there were also about 6 other flights available that day out of Raleigh. Even though the lady on the phone wasn't friendly at least she was patient and helpful. Sadly this isn't the end of my story, I ended up having a connection flight home, of course my first flight out of Raleigh was delayed so I had to run to the next gate.

American Airlines,1,Lea Douglas,17th February 2016,"Barely professional and calmly arrogant. Both outbound and inbound flights with American Airlines were problematic to put it discretely. Outbound from Albuquerque (ABQ) to LA we waited on the tarmac for nearly an hour for what was explained as ""too much weight"". This enlarged into needing to correct the paperwork for this weight problem and finally into having to burn off fuel to eliminate the extra weight. Overall confusing and seeming disorganized in the first place. Our last leg through Phoenix to ABQ was a true mess. We came in on an overnight flight from Honolulu with a connecting flight leaving at app. 9am for Abq. However, we were held in Phoenix until 2pm due to ""mechanical problems"" with our assigned plane. This plane was still in Austin, (or so the gate staff said but the Customer service staff office nearby said it had departed earlier). As we sat and waited one could hear constant AA gate changes followed by a rush of passengers to elsewhere. The question steaming through our passenger group was simply, is there not another aircraft available when such a thing happens? Will we need to hustle to squeeze on to the next scheduled fight to Abq? Shall we rent a car and drive? The stressed gate staff kept announcing new and later departure times with no other info available. Then suddenly (our) plane arrived and after waiting briefly for a co pilot we left app. 5 hours late. The impression left was one of being in a gritty country called AA where chaos, lack of information and customer service is casually routine and where shareholders and yet greater profits are really the primary goal.

Now we have to sit apart and I can't even sit in my seat comfortably because the man next to me takes up half of my seat too. Not one person from the airline has even apologized to us. Then after loading the plane we find out that there is technical problems with the plane and we returned to the terminal.

American Airlines,1,Matt Crook,12th February 2016,"Washington to San José. I made a mistake booking my AA Ticket online. Luckily the DOT requires airlines to allow you to make changes (with no fee) for up to 24 hours after booking a flight. I realized my mistake and called a mere 10 minutes after my original booking and informed the airline of the mistake and asked to change to the correct flight. The correct flight was the same price so it was a simple change. All went well and they agreed to change it no problems. (I thought) the correct flight was booked, and all was well. As I prepared for my trip, I realized my itinerary on aa.com was still the original flight. I call AA and they informed me that although they can see I called in, they have no record of the change. I explained that the reason I called (obviously) was to correct the itinerary, but they must not have done so. Despite the fact that they could see I called - they still wouldn't change my flight without the $200 change fee, since the operator apparently didn't annotate in the notes why I called, or change the flight correctly. Since all I have is a call log, and not a recording of the call, not sure how I would prove it. I'm not upset they made a mistake fixing my mistake (I made a mistake too after all) - what upsets me is that they are so insistent on charging that $200 change fee - even after I can show them that the itinerary should've been fixed when I called them the first time!

American's next and final option was to offer a hotel at a distress rate. They did not solve our problem. I had to rent a car and drive myself to my final destination in order to be on time. Submitted a complaint on aa.com. Got an automated response stating they were not liable for my missed flight or the delay. A refund for the flight may be available in 4 to 6 weeks, but not for the rental car. This airline should not offer connections that are not possible to make. It was impossible for me to travel through two terminals in 10 minutes to catch my flight. Their representative showed no empathy and was acting like I was the reason my connection was missed.

Despite the very short duration of the Austin to Dallas flight, they attempted to serve everyone onboard the drink of their choice (not just water), which was quite impressive. I appreciated the effort and polite service of the crew. My only criticism was the plane - American Airlines MD80's are very old, and it shows.

The airline had two hours to figure out who would be missing what flight and to coordinate effectively with the hotel for a seamless transition. Instead we waited in the cold and ended up at a hotel that was 20 mins away from the hotel, one that only had a shuttle once an hour and we almost missed the kitchen due to their laziness and poor planning.

American Airlines,9,Alexander Chaple,7th February 2016,"London to New York JFK, returning from Miami, and great flights with in Business Class on Boeing 777-300. The space, comfort, and privacy on this aircraft is second to none. The cabin crew were courteous and helpful (most of my flights with AA have been in coach where the rudeness of the staff used to be legendary). On both flights, the FA greeted by name, confirmed my meal order with me (requested on line) and took my coat. Outbound lunch was good, as were the wines. Drinks constantly replenished. A selection of snacks was laid out in the bar between meals, although I didn’t try them. The pre-landing snack was croque monsieur, which was ok but really no better than the pizza that you used to get in coach many years ago. Before landing, the purser walked through the cabin thanking each passenger for flying AA. A nice touch. Bose noise cancelling headphones are superb, although they collect them almost an hour before landing. On the return from MIA, the food and service were again very good. The steak on flights starting the in the US is always better than on those starting in the UK, and it was served on a very hot plate. The salad was excellent. FA asked if I wanted to be woken for breakfast. Although I didn’t I was awake when breakfast came round and it was surprisingly good. I’d previously flown Business Class on the US Airways A330. The 777-300 seat is similar but improved. There is no gap between the seat and the wall, where things can be lost on the A330. There is a vanity mirror in the storage cupboard. The TV screens are larger (15”). The seats have more adjustable positions. However, there is no storage under the footrest. A nice lightweight duvet and large fluffy pillow added to the comfort. The seats are a bit hard when sitting fully upright or fully flat for any length of time, but are very comfortable when reclined. Sleeping on the way back, the plane was very warm and I slept on top of the duvet which was very comfortable indeed. The washrooms on this plane are very nice, particularly the one on the starboard size which is double sized. The equipment makes this Boeing 777-300 the best business class across the Atlantic, and the service was up to par. The downside of this plane is that all the seats are very private, and if you are travelling with a companion then even in the middle pair you can’t really see or talk to each other. If you want to socialise with a travelling companion, you may not like this plane. IFE was fair, not a lot of new films but enough newish and classics to keep me happy. I've marked down ground service because of a problem at LHR. I am gay and was travelling with my partner. The check in operative at tried to make us check in separately. When I asked if married couples had to check in separately she said no. I explained that my travelling companion was my Civil Partner, and that we had the same legal rights as a married couple. She was embarrassed and apologetic, but making assumptions about peoples sexuality is inappropriate.

Service was friendly and rather informal. The food was good – the steak was better than on the flight over from London.

Having flown into JFK in International Business Class, we had access to the Admiral's Club Lounge. These lounges are poor compared to British Airways.

American Airlines,1,L Kolfhaus,6th February 2016,"I hope it was the last time with American Airlines! I had to fly both ways to Philadelphia and back to Germany with American although on my flight list it said I would fly with Iberia and British Airways. Maybe I had really bad luck but on both flights there were mayor problems concerning delay. Before the first flight we were told, the aircraft is going to stop halfway to refuel so we would have a delay of several hours (they couldn't really tell us how much exactly). Having advised my transport ability from the airport to my final destination that I wouldn't arrive at time, we were told after a good half of the flight that we are going to fly directly to Philadelphia (as initially planned) because we had less wind than expected. The second flight was worse. The plane we were going to take arrived at Philly 20 min later than planned, so everything already was a bit delayed. After sitting in this machine over 1h without departing, we had to change plane(!) which lasted another hour, so we arrived at Amsterdam with over 2 hours of delay. While changing planes in Philadelphia I heard from several passengers that this is typical for AA, that they had come to Philly with a delayed AA flight and that they would never be able to get their train (just as me!) or connecting flight (except an American Airlines flight because that one you get because of its delay again - so if you fly AA, only fly AA). If there weren't all the other critical aspects in comparison to the flights' price. On other transatlantic flights of the same duration and price with Lufthansa or KLM, a personal screen with plenty of movies to chose is standard. Just as 2 ordinary meals plus snacks and comfortable seats with room for legs. On each of these 2 American Airlines flights, I had a disgusting meal and a tiny snack, there were small screens over every 5th row you can't see well from the mayority of seats (I had the luck of having one of these) and the seat couldn't be adjusted more than 2 inches backwards, so falling asleep wasn't possible for me, also because of permanent knee-seat-contact and the absolute impossibility of stretching my legs.

American Airlines,1,Lesley Goodyk,4th February 2016,"My husband and I paid $311 extra for our seats to and from Honolulu for our dream vacation with American Airlines. These fees were so that we could sit together for the flights and for extra leg room. We never got the extra leg room on any of the 4 flights and had to argue with the counter people to even get to sit together. For example, when checking in with AA mobile app (which doesn't work well) for our flight from Honolulu to Phoenix, the app showed our assigned seats as being available for an extra fee (which we had already paid). We were then assigned standard seats (no leg room) and 6 rows apart. Finally, we got a counter agent to at least sit us together for the flight but we were told that this was a ""different plane so seats were different"". If this was even true, isn't it good business to take care of those that paid extra for better seats and then assign remaining standard fare seats? It appears that American charges at least double for this bait and switch. Who knows how many ""extra"" fees they charged for special seating and then assigned standard seats? We know for a fact that they did so on the HNL to PHX flight, as we spoke to the people occupying our originally assigned seats. The flight to Honolulu was so bad that my arm was cramped against the cabin wall resulting in numbness for most of the flight.

While we sat on the plane, they kept announcing that equipment was malfunctioning and delaying us. Yes, weather can happen, but there was no attention to customer satisfaction after that - not even a little extra like free food. We lost $72 needing to get a hotel room near Atlanta that night, losing the money for the pre-booked hotel in Savannah we couldn't get to.

American Airlines,5,John Drennan,23rd January 2016,"Chicago to London Heathrow with American Airlines, and it was graceless from start to finish. No wait at check-in and through security in about 25 minutes. On a business class ticket you can access the Admirals Club lounge, which comes with a coupon for one free drink (including bottled water)!. Even then there's an expectation that you'll have to tip the barman who provides it. Otherwise, it's a few cheese crackers, cheese cubes and assorted nuts. There's a water fountain in the lounge, if you're really thirsty. Boarding was quick and stress free, and the refurbished Boeing 767-300 business class cabin offers a lof of personal space. There was a very long and unexplained wait after boarding until the doors were closed, and a further wait until pushback. You'd think that the flight attendants would be thinking ahead to how they'd be able to get on with service quicker on a night flight, such as taking dinner and drinks orders, but no, all standing around in the galley chatting. After take-off the flight attendants got out of their seats after 30 minutes. The next step was to manually log out 30 entertainment tablets and noise-cancelling earphones, so that was another 30 minutes gone. It was 90 minutes from take-off before the first drink hit the table. Dinner orders were then taken, and the meal service got under way. The cabin was kept at full illumination, with no attempt to create any form of night-time ambience. The starter was a mushroom carpaccio, which was very tasty, followed by what you'd think would a safe option 'steak in demi-glaze of blue-cheese'. The demi-glaze looked like oatmeal, and the steak was bloody in the middle, so after a few cuts, the blood started running everywhere, and it quickly became a pink, inedible mess. The dessert was ice-cream, which took a full 15 minutes before you could even crack off a chip with a spoon. The flight attendants were regularly doing the rounds throughout the flight, and nobody wanted for a drink. I passed on on the breakfast option of a quiche lorraine and spicy sausage, as this seemed like the perfect recipe for early-morning heartburn. The seat was extremely comfortable, but if you're looking for a business class product that delivers some style and atmosphere, this isn't it.",Boeing 767-300,Business,Business Class,ORD to LHR,January 2016,4,4,2,3,2,3,yes

Inconvenient, but not horrible until we tried to get reimbursed for hotel (Miami on NYE), basic clothing, and food needs (family of 5). You have to put your request in online and guess what? They won't respond for 6-8 weeks. Tried calling and they only have canned response to wait for the online response. You are stuck and there is nothing you can do about it.

US Airways customer service was professional and accommodating to the customer. We purchased tickets for a trip from Fayetteville to Montego Bay in April 2016 months ago. American airlines canceled two of our initial connecting flights we had booked, no problem we understand its business on their part. But when they rescheduled our flights for us the new flight times did not allow time between flights for customs, rechecking bags as we re-entered the country and changing terminals. When we called to get assistance changing these new flights (that AA had changed) their representatives were anything but accommodating! Rude as I explained that we could not make connecting flights as they had rescheduled, the supervisor told me I could say the sky was blue but it didn't change that they couldn't refund me for flights I wanted to cancel - and remember they are the ones who changed my flight scheduling flights without enough time to make connections. She just kept telling me no refund because it was me wanting a schedule change. When I asked her to help me cancel these flights altogether and start a new flight schedule she said no, that I needed to go online and do it myself, because our call had already taken 60 minutes.

We waited from 10:30pm - 3:00am to have our flight rescheduled (which left over 24 hours after our original flight) and have accommodation organised. We arrived at our accommodation to find that American Airlines credit card declined 4 times. We were then asked if we would go to a new hotel at 2:30am which required us to use a shuttle that left every 20 min to go back to the airport and then go on a 2nd 20min shuttle to go to the new hotel. It is currently 3:30am and they are yet to provide a credit card that has been accepted for a $115 payment. They also provided a $7 food voucher.

After 40 minutes, advised that maintenance needed to isolate etc etc. After almost an hour of sitting on the plane, we were finally asked to get off plane and go to another gate to board another flight. The guy making announcements was whispering so we all weren't quite sure which gate. When asking the lady at the gate for clarification she was barking at everyone and acting like we were bothering her. Waking up at 2:30am for a 5am flight with an eta of 7:30am is doable if it goes according to plan - this was painful. Needless to say, I was not quite sure I was in capable hands after 2 hours of them fumbling around. We got to Dallas 2hrs later! Thankfully we did not have a connecting flight after.

American Airlines,8,John Drennan,19th January 2016,"American Airlines from London Heathrow to Chicago was one of the best business flights I've had for a long time. Check-in and bag-drop took seconds and the lounge was quiet and fairly empty first thing in the day. I chose this flight as it was the newly-configured business cabin on the Boeing 767-300. Overall impression very good, seemed spacious and every seat is an aisle seat, which is a huge plus. I had a window seat, and it actually was a window seat - rather other airlines where you sit at an angle and have to twist to look out. The seat had a large fixed table area between the seat and the aisle, so there was no possibility of being knocked by someone on their way past. Like all new products there were a few design issues. You have to be more or less upright before you can release and then raise the table, but you get the hang of it eventually. The seat controls are very sensitive and you can often accidentally move your seat if you arm is laying where it normally would. The meal service was good, pre-ordered main course was there, and it seemed a very honest product. A very cheap appetiser, just humous, olives and pitta bread but then a delicious fish main course, with a choice of dessert and cheese. You had to wait for the entertainment system to be distributed after take-off, in the form of content loaded tablets and noise-reducing headphones. The 767's were always noisy old crates, but if you take along your own headphones and entertainment, there's no need to wait for theirs (although there is a huge choice of material). The seat was one of the most comfortable I've sat in for ages, it moved around easily, and in combination with a built in footstool, it wans't long before I had found the perfect position and was so comfortable I didn't want to get up. I'm tall, and couldn't reach the back of the footwell however hard I tried, so it felt like there was real space to stretch out. The afternoon snack was again straightforward, a charcuterie plate of meats, cheeses and breads plus cookies. Looked after well by the flight attendants throughout the flight.

When we arrived in Cancun, one of our 2 suitcase didn't arrive. The AA computer reports that it is in Miami and it will follow the next morning on the 9am flight, so we happily head to our hotel. We've never seen the bag since and it's now 3 weeks later. If we check on the computer, it says the bag has not been located and to check back later. If we call, we are told the same thing. I feel like no-one is looking for my bag and it's just a case of 'computer says no'. All they tell us is to fill out their outdated paper based property form and send off a claim with receipts for all items over a certain value (which we don't have for everything in the case). I feel like no-one cares that my bag with some prized possessions has gone missing and they will just pay out - I'm expecting less than the full amount the case is worth, due to not being able to provide receipts for things that were a gift / more than a couple of years old.

When I got our boarding passes in Vancouver, the seats I paid $75 extra each for in row 8 were not the ones I was given, even though I had the confirmation. When I asked the girl at the American Airlines desk she couldn't help me and said to ask in Dallas. I called customer service, they still had me listed in row 8, not in row 17 and 16 (my son and I weren't even together now), then my wallet app ticket updated so I called customer service again - they still had us in row 8. In Dallas we were stuck with rows 17 and 16, not the seats I paid for, and then found out how difficult it is to get a refund for something that is clearly their fault. We got to Boston at 12:37am and our 4 bags, two suitcases and two ski bags didn't make it. The woman at the counter was rude. I reviewed a call in the morning saying my two ski bags made it and would be delivered by 2pm (I should mention my son was going back to college the next day) but they didn't know where my other two bags were and I was told to call back in a bit. I call back and my two bags were still in Texas and they ""hoped"" they would be here on the 3 pm flight. I called the 800 number quite a few times trying to get a straight answer and was told different things each time. Finally around 5pm I was told my other two bags had made it to Boston. I called to see where my ski bags were as it was past 2 and no bags yet. I was told they didn't make it to Boston until 2 so how could they be promised to be here by then I was told. Finally the driver called and said he'd have my ski bags here by 11pm! I never heard about the delivery of my other two bags so I called once again, got told they would ""rush"" the delivery as 4 hours later they were still at the airport - finally I got an email saying the delivery has started. The ski bags arrived close to 11 and the other two bags about 10 min later. What a hellish experience. We had to waste my sons last day home for winter break waiting for suitcases that didn't come when we were told, and I made hours of phone calls and was given a run around. I am confident had I not called and kept after my bags, they'd still be out there. Horrible customer service and they lie.

American Airlines,2,Noah VanGorder,12th January 2016,"The American Airlines flight from Detroit to San Antonio was not overly noteworthy. They handled the flight as expected with friendly staff, nice aircrafts, and pleasant flight times. However on the return trip, my girlfriend and myself were not impressed in the least. We arrived two hours early for our flight as expected and proceeded to wait for our plane. We weren't informed at any time that our aircraft was behind schedule, however it landed roughly twenty minutes past the time we were supposed to board. After the plane arrived we were informed that no carryon ""larger than a briefcase"" do all passangers needed to valet check their bags. This created an interesting issue when boarding as a pile of carryons began to block the path onto the plane. After boarding a plane that seemed to have been built in the seventies, we were informed that we were not going to be able to leave for 40 minutes due to weather in our connector in chicago; something that is to be expected this time of year. What wasn't expected was the condescending attitude of the entire staff. A fellow passanger stated that they needed to check the landing time, because he was going to a military funeral he would rather not miss. The flight attendant stated that they couldn't control the weather and walked away. After a hellish two and a half hour flight in an old, loud, cramped plane we arrived in Chicago for our layover. We than had to wait twenty minutes in the jetway while they unloaded each individual bag into the mass of passangers; noteworthy at this time is that Chicago was sitting at 6 degrees. We rush through the terminal to our connector flight and make it right as the plane is boarding. I give the employer at the gate my ticket and begin to walk to the airplane. He cleared his throat and stated my bags, that I had taken all of the way to Texas as a carryon, were to large for the flight. I inform him they are the same ones we went down to Texas with, but apparently that is not enough. Because he stated that I must place them into a size verifier to show that they are in fact acceptable. I preceeded to place them into the bracket, which showed them to clearly be the correct size. His response was to turn around and simply walk away, leaving me to puzzle over the correct next step. Overall, I felt belittled, and outright disrepected.

American Airlines,1,K Washko,11th January 2016,"I will pay a premium to fly with other airlines in the future. Our American Airlines departure from Miami was so stressful after a much needed vacation to decompress. We arrived 2-1/2 hours early and went to the AA terminal to check in. There were lines at every kiosk and hundreds of people waiting on line throughout. We got on line and waited 40 minutes at a kiosk (several were out of service it seems). Everyone who got a turn at bat eventually arrived a problem which required a customer service person to come over and help them. The help mainly consisted of sending them to the baggage check/kiosk service lines. Our turn was no different. As our baggage tags began to print, the machine had a glitch, indicating that it was probably out of tag stickers. We flagged down a customer rep who - you guessed it - sent us to the baggage check/kiosk service line where we waited another hour plus. Everyone we watched was having to remove stuff from their bags and this was very time consuming. When we got to the front of the line, they weighed our bag (which was the identical bag we had flown in with - nothing added!) and told us it was 2 lbs over and we could remove items or pay a $100 upcharge for the overweight bag. Since by now our flight was boarding and we still had not gone through security, we felt compelled to pay the charge. As we were boarding, our daughter with a smaller bag carry on was forced to check it anyway, as most of the other passengers were also being forced to check. (Why did we bother to stand in line for 2 hours if the flight attendants were tagging bags at boarding?) A woman on our flight told us how they were forced to layover in Miami overnight after waiting in the airport all day. They were not comped for their room. Several people on that flight missed connections for their vacations, and one couple missed their cruise.

American Airlines,1,Sommer Perry,10th January 2016,"I am an AAdvantage member and American Airlines credit card holder and I was just hung up on by an American Airlines supervisor. I fly monthly to weekly for work with multiple airlines. I am flying with American Airlines tomorrow from Madison to Seattle via Chicago. After my travel agent booked my flight I went onto my mobile app to select my seat. All the open seats had an up charge to select them. So, I decided to wait to get a seat assignment at check in. This morning I checked in on my mobile app. I was assigned a seat and given my boarding pass like usual. A few hours later I got on to the seat selection portion of my app. It showed the seat I was in did not recline. It also showed that all the seats except one in the back still had an up charge. So, I picked the seat in the back of the plane. After confirming my seat change I saw that the seat I had been assigned originally was a preferred seat with extra leg room and priority boarding. It also showed that to move back to that seat I was initially assigned I would have to pay an up charge. I decided to call reservations to see if there was anything I could do to keep the same seat level I'd been assigned but switch to one that reclines. This is a 4 hour flight at 5am after all. The rep said she couldn't explain what happened and couldn't help me because I was already signed in. She did say that it shouldn't have happened (all seats shouldn't have up charges and I should've been able to move seats in the cabin I was assigned). So, I decided to call the mobile app technical support line to see if they could at least tell me what happened. The tech person sent me to a supervisor who was supposed to be able to help. The supervisor listened to me explain what happened then proceeded to accuse me of lying because it didn't line up with the activity on my account. She said I would've had to pay for my original seat assignment claiming I hadn't completed my transaction and had I gone to the ""last screen"" I would've been asked for a credit card. I explained that I didn't ever ask for an upgrade and that I merely checked in and did fully check in without ever being asked for a credit card or told I had priority seating. I also told her I had the preferred seat on my boarding pass. She said that had I kept that seat and gone to the airport tomorrow, I would've been told I had to pay $68 or switch to whatever seats were left open at the back of the plane. I told her that sound strange and didn't seem like great customer service. She then asked ""what are doing right now"". I explained I was just looking for an explanation of what happened (was it an issue with my app?) and looking for someone to make me feel like a valued customer. I really wanted to understand what went wrong, I fly too much to deal with this and have never had anything like this happen before. The woman then rather heatedly announced that they are the best airline in the world. I told her our conversation wasn't demonstrating that and that the reason we were talking right now was because I wanted to give them a chance to show me that. I asked if she could just help me understand what happened and confirm the issue wasn't there for the other leg of my flight. She then told me to have a nice day and hung up on me. I was shocked.

Boarding the plane was greeted by friendly staff. Approximately 20 minutes after take off, the drinks service commences along with a bag of pretzels. The first meal follows around 30 minutes after, with another drinks service. Litter is cleared quickly and another beverage service. About 2 hours later a beverage service and ice cream. Approximately 90 minutes before landing, a beverage and second meal is served. The food is decent, didn't like the sandwich, however, would have much preferred the pizza they used to serve. Boeing 757 does not have any seatback televisions except for Business Class, I brought a tablet with films pre-loaded, and it was a life saver.

American Airlines,5,Catalin-Alexandru Epure,9th January 2016,"I booked flights with British Airways, and I was put on the way back from Orange County to London to travel with their partner, American airlines, via Dallas. The first segment was OK and landed in time in a new Boieng 737-800. There was WiFi on board, although very very expensive. The problems started in Dallas, where after boarding, we had to wait in an old Boeing 777-200 for 1.5 hours, for the luggage to be unloaded and redistributed so that the weight of the aircraft to be ideal. After take-off, the IFE started to work, but you couldn't just play the movie you wanted, you could either jump in the middle of it, or wait about 15 minutes until it will start again. As it wasn't enough, this system went out of power doing the middle of the movie, the crew had no idea and after 30 minutes it came back to life. Of course, I had to watch a movie 3 times from the beginning as you couldn't fast forward or anything. The food was generally bad, as was the wine they gave us. Just a small blanket and a pillow, no other things for the night. The crew didn't give much of an interest. I guess the old entertainment system was just because it was a night flight (scheduled departure 22:10) and not many people use it. That is why I rate it as an average experience.

We flew from New York back to Manchester with American Airlines. We booked in 3 hours before take off to arrange we sat together. We were made to book in by machine in the terminal. They seated us nowhere near each other although seats together were plainly visible on said console, when we mentioned this to the staff they told us we would be able to change this at the gate. No you can't. The stroppy little madam who appears half an hour before gate closure refused point blank to alter seating, despite families with young children being separated, unless you paid extra for seating. There was no attempt to seat people together in New York. The entertainment for the flight to Manchester was a tiny overhead screen you couldn't see in the centre aisle which weren't worth neck ache to see. Food and drinks were okay, thank goodness the flight was only 7 hours. Only two toilets. The internal flights between destinations in America were worse - we were only offered three drinks, one of which was water, no food despite the flight being 7 hours. American Airlines does not include food and drinks.

Seat back entertainment didn't work for me, USB chargers on both seats didn't work. Cabin crew weren't exactly professional, and down right silly on the PHL-YHZ leg (not aware that Halifax has a different time zone, no idea of scheduled arrival time, generally inarticulate). The aircraft from PHL-YHZ (operated by American Eagle) had an old plane smell, and the bleak interior of the ERJ 145 seemed to be yellowing with age. Good communication from the pilots on this leg, which was necessary as there were repeated delays ending in a 30 minute broken down jetway farce at the Halifax airport.

They told me ""we don't hold planes for anyone"" and proceeded to laugh at me and then looked at me with a puzzling stare when I told them we were headed to Ireland. We ran through the airport and made it to the gate at 8:59 as the doors were closing. I was dripping in sweat and good barely breath as I gave the ticket to the gate agent. I said ""I'm sorry it's the airlines fault we are late."" She said ""it most certainly is not!"". I said ""our plane was delayed 1 hour 35 minutes!"". She said ""well it's not my fault!"". If we were not young and in relatively good shape and had some luck with the bus being quick, we would have not made this flight.

I paid $900 just to go home for the holidays and without a choice had to purchase a First Class Seat with no seats left on one of the the returning connecting flights. The departure home went smooth but the return to Fayetteville was a nightmare. My original flight out of Sacramento was continuously delayed till 11 am the next morning. Because of this I got bumped like crazy and the worst part I had to deal with before arriving to Dallas was the fact I had no alternative but to sit there until 4am the next morning and reclaim my luggage to recheck by that time to. No food before the checkpoint but luckily being Military there was a USO with cots to sleep on. I waited back at the terminal B but the AA counter did not open past 4am as a few other showed up. My hit time was passing and I ran to another terminal when I found out it was actually open. The response from the attendant was I was too late and should have 'known better' to come to that terminal. By this time I was exhausted, hungry, and worn out. I got lucky with a flight in the next hour. I get to Charlotte, NC with another delayed flight and find out I'm actually on standby. The flight to Fayetteville is a later time and have to wait till then to see if I'm able to get a seat. Finally after arriving to Fay, NC I go to get my luggage. Turns out they didn't send it and the bags are still in Charlotte. In the end the only person who was around was a nice baggage man who got my bags to me later that night. I was a day late signing back in with the Military and with that First Class Seat wasted $30 as that never happened.

American Airlines,1,T Krofe,31st December 2015,"American Airlines took full advantage of a high-price round-trip ticket from LGA to CLT airports. Instead we had to fly LGA to CLT leaving NYC, and CLT to EWR returning to NYC. Yes, they had a jacked up the price by $200/ticket just to fly round-trip. If this was first class with an airline that was dependable, maybe I'd pay the price, but not when I know it's already going to be bad. I was right, it was bad. We stood online coming home from CLT, scanning our boarding passes. Some passengers sat down on the plane, we were just about to step onto the plane. Before we get one foot on, we are told there is a 1.5 hour delay. We now have to all exit the plane, un-scan our boarding passes. 40 minutes later we have to board again. Passengers were late assuming they had 1.5 hours to eat. We should have boarded the plane from the start since it took 45 minutes just to get all the passengers seated and carry-on's handled. We could've saved some time then. I stopped flying with AA since I had options, now they merged with US Airways and I'm out of luck.

American Airlines,1,Noel Yanes,31st December 2015,"My family and I had a flight to San Salvador scheduled on Dec. 16, 2015 at 1 pm. We arrived an hour earlier to turn in our luggage and receive our boarding passes but when we got to TSA we realized the guy gave us the wrong boarding passes which belonged to someone else who was going to the Dominican Republic. We went back to the man who seemed like he had no idea what he was doing because he kept asking the other person next to him for help. Once everything was taken care of we headed back to TSA and went through the process. By the time we arrived at the gate we were not allowed to enter because we were late. The lady at the desk refused to help us board another flight, instead she went to text on her phone. Another lady helped get on a flight with TACA airlines. Things got worse after that. We had to go on separate flights to Miami. I arrived at 9 pm and my mother with my 2 younger sisters arrived at 10 pm. Next we went to board our flight with TACA airlines. We had to walk across the entire airport to find TACA. Then had to wait until 3:52 am for our plane to arrive. We finally got on the plane but later we found out they were going to stop at Nicaragua for a while and from there we would arrive to San Salvador. In Boston we were told our luggage would arrive to San Salvador before we did. TACA told us the same in Miami but when we arrived to San Salvador our luggage was nowhere to be found. We received our luggage almost a week later but my bag did not arrive. I was forced to buy clothes in El Salvador because I never received my bag. I came back on Tuesday Dec. 29 2015.

Every flight that he was supposed to get on was either cancelled or delayed. And no one from American Airlines will even tell me if he is even on a flight from Dallas to Orlando yet.

American Airlines,1,Jennifer Heller,29th December 2015,"Our trip was originally scheduled for San Francisco to Dallas Fort-Worth (Flight #2417), and Dallas Fort-Worth to Piedmont (#5812) in North Carolina. Flight from SFO to DFW departed and landed with no complications. Original leave time for flight #5812 on Sunday was to depart at approximately 8:30, to land in GSO at 11:05. Our troubles began when the gate changed from B47 to B1 with no notice or confirmation. The only reason we found out was from a non-airport flight tracker web site. Waiting at B1 with the rest of the people scheduled to take the flight, our gate was then changed again, back to B47 with no confirmation or notification from the airport. At this time the gate personnel at B1 still had no idea. The only reason we found out, again was from a non-affiliate web site. After running to the gate at the other end of the airport with 5 minutes to spare, (this because the Sky Link was broken) we made it to B47. At B47 there was no Gate attendant, only a message on the screen informing us that the flight would depart at the scheduled time. As we watched the scheduled time come and go, again with no gate attendant in sight the screen changed again with a later departure time, still no gate attendant at this time. After 2 hours a non-related flight attendant traveling with our group answered the ringing phone, to inform the control center that there was no gate attendant, no pilot, no crew, and that the plane had been sitting there since when we first arrived. About 5 minutes later the supervisor showed up. She was unresponsive to anyone’s questions, and refused to talk to anyone. She got on the phone a few times, typed in the computer and we watched the departure time change again. Only this time is was changed to 11:00, which was the same time as another scheduled flight. These people were also now at the gate and as confused as we were (because the airport flight screens said both our flights would be leaving at the same time, from the same gate). We finally got word that we were waiting on a crew, and we watched a pilot and two stewardesses board the plane. Again, no notice from any gate personnel. After we watched the now changed 11:30 departure time come and go, we watched the pilot and two stewardesses deboard the plane. Still no one at our gate to answer any questions, as the supervisor had left hours before. We asked the pilot and stewardesses what was happening and they responded that they had been sitting on the plane for too long, and were now over their hours. They also informed us once they walked away there was no one to fill their spots, and the flight would inevitably be cancelled. Again no notice from the screen that still said it was departing at 11:30, which at this time it was 12:30. I called, and they rebooked us to fly out Monday, from Dallas to Ft. Meyers, to Charlotte, then Greensboro. The woman on the phone then told me that she could not give vouchers for hotels over the phone; to go back to the attendant we first spoke with. American Airlines will never get our business. I refuse to pay thousands of dollars, and be made to feel the way we were treated. It’s one thing to be delayed due to weather, its one thing to have flights canceled, but to have your employees make us feel like pawns in your monopoly is ridiculous.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to GSO via DFW,December 2015,1,1,,,1,1,no
American Airlines,6,Davide Greco,29th December 2015,"Flew Chicago to Miami with my girlfriend on Dec 2nd then on to Milano a few days later: the international flight was an Iberia ticket operated by AA which I explicitly selected as I wanted a direct flight to Milano on the way back. I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.","Boeing 737-800, Boeing 767-300",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to MXP via MIA,December 2015,3,3,2,1,2,3,no
American Airlines,1,J Wagner,29th December 2015,"I am a frequent flier platinum member I book about 60,000 base miles (miles actually flown) on this airline a year and a fly a lot of other airlines as well. I have been an advantage member for about 20 years. I have progressively seen this airline degenerate and as of today take advantage of its customers. Customer service is almost non existent, the $200 change fee is uncalled for especially for frequent fliers. The problem is I don't think that they are trying, also I have been very keen on the price increases (sometimes close to 70% increase) brought about by the merger where now American is the only carrier to certain routes. For some reason in my experience one out of every 30 flights gets cancelled (or just my luck) for a non distinct reason, I don't want to accuse but usually I can intuitionally predict when this will happen, that is when I see that its substantially empty a week before the flight. Delays are ever more frequent, in the last three flights we had a 30 minute delay because they were still loading bags, three other delays for flight attendants not in or pilots not in yet. No snacks, and the food for purchase which is not much is usually not even available as they stock very little of it and the tempting items are taken quickly. The advantage program keeps getting changed not for the better. If the prices were cheap I would not complain as much. The few planes that have the new IFE system carry vey little media and no free tv, also the gogo in flight is really too expensive for the average passenger, if it was a reasonable rate I would use it for other than the occasional free partial pass.

This second flight was also cancelled last minute, and we were told that we would either be able to put on a standby for a flight 4 hours later flight or get booked for a flight two days later, the latter was clearly not an option. To my disbelief, about an hour and a half later flights began leaving for Dallas without our knowledge, it was not announced on the PA system. Eventually, we got on a flight at 10pm, but it doesn't end there, our flight to Calgary was already cancelled. The next flight from Dallas to Calgary was supposed to depart at 10.50am the next day. We did not board until 11.45am, and as the plane was getting ready to depart, one of the engines failed, resulting in the plane going out of service, and the cancellation of the flight.

I had a broken seat on the return that did not recline. It didn't matter that our luggage was lost again on the return because we were home. What did matter was that after contacting American Airlines about our problems, they did not even respond until the 3rd letter and then told us that it is not their policy to give any compensation for lost luggage unless we had purchased approved items and had saved all receipts.

As I sat at the gate, I watched how other flyers had avoided the charge. Their too-large carry-ons were collected at the gate and checked-at no charge. No honest person would have thought these bags the correct size. After my arrival, I called customer service. It was a 40 minute wait. When I got through, the lady asked if I had the AAdvantage credit card. I said no. She said the baggage charges were correct, only cardholders are exempted baggage fees. This morning, I checked their website again and again. It is not easily followed. The credit card and the frequent flyer program use the same name. If you get the credit card, you are exempted the baggage fee. If you fly 20,000 miles in their program, you are exempted the baggage fee. It took plenty of clicks to piece this together.

This is understandable, however the updates were coming sluggishly and unapologetically. After being in the airport since 12 for a 1.30 flight, at 4 I rebooked my flight for today at 5am. It took about 35 min for a very disgruntled worker to even attend to me while I was waiting to try and retrieve me already checked bag. At 4am I arrive at GRK, Killeen Airport and and told by the very rude, digruntled lady (from yesterday) that my 5am flight has been canceled and the next flight isn't until 12 midday. She was unapologetic and very rude. This airport predominately serves the Army community and it is sad that we are subjected to such treatment.

They were informed there were no more flights out that night. At no time were they given a blanket, pillow, food, etc. They slept on the floor of the airport.

They would have to take personal leave time for the time spent in the airport due to a situation out of their control. They then rented a car with their own money to drive to Co Springs.

Apart from a boring diner and a breakfast which I would recommend anyone to stay away from at any cost, the crew is only performing routinely, smiling and extra pampering optional. It seems that their presence is strictly contained at maintaining the cabin within permissible safety standards, all other tasks being sidelined.

Hubby and I boarded an overnight flight departing Los Angeles at 10:40 pm, scheduled to arrive in Tampa at 6:15 a.m. We didn't eat in the Admirals Club at LAX because we assumed we'd be served a meal, or at least a sandwich on the flight. We boarded the plane to find a substandard first class cabin. Carry-on bags barely fit into the overhead compartments. There was no lie-flat seating. There wasn't even a pillow! Seriously, on an overnight flight - no pillow in first class? Then we found out there was no food either! American cuts off food service at 10:00 pm, which is ridiculous. We'd just flown overnight with Hawaiian Air the previous night, and they served a full dinner after take-off at 1:30am. Yet American didn't even offer the traditional snack basket. We were doled out a handful of warm nuts, and a cookie. Plan on starving with American. Speaking of no bed and no food, the third ""no"" we encountered was no entertainment. During a 5-hour flight, they didn't even offer tablets. We were totally on our own. The flight attendant did inform us that, if we happened to bring our own tablet, we could purchase movies during the flight. I kid you not - in first class they want you to buy your own entertainment. Then the dingbat flight attendant failed to turn on the cabin lights for the first half hour of the flight, so we couldn't even read our own books. We sat in total darkness twiddling our thumbs. Summing up American Airlines first class cabin on a 5-hour overnight flight, there is: No lie-flat seat No pillow, No food, No snacks, No entertainment, Extended darkness.

My last trip was delay 2 hours at take off and they told me to check on connecting flights at the next destination. They would not even tell me before takeoff if they could book me to my destination.

I paid for upgraded seats and was assigned center aisles or back of plane next to the washroom. On the return flight that was supposed to arrive at 8PM it arrived at past midnight.

A large number of people travel in pairs, and it's nice to be able to sit together without having to share a row of seats. It's for that reason that, when flying economy, I try, wherever possible to choose a route served by Airbus 330 or 340. The American Airlines economy seats are wide and comfortable. The IFE is very US biased, but, of course this is an American airline. Last time I flew AA, I felt the $5 charge for drinks was ridiculous, and I'm pleased to see that they have seen the error of their ways and reverted to generous free supply of beer and wine as well as soft drinks. I'd have no hesitation using this very convenient route from N Spain to Florida (BCN to MIA) again in the future.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BCN to MIA,December 2015,4,4,4,3,4,5,yes

American Airlines,1,Cylie Folmar,20th December 2015,"American Airlines is the absolute worst airline I have ever flown. I am a 15 year old unaccompanied minor, not only were they unprofessional, they were rude, unhelpful and their flights have a habit of getting canceled. I am currently stuck in the Phoenix airport in route to Corning, New York because my connecting flight to Philly was canceled due to them being unable to find a pilot. When asked about flights I was told I had to wait until 2:45 pm today to get on a flight that is 12 hours past the time I was supposed to arrive in New York. I arrived in Phoenix from El Paso at 8 PM yesterday. It's 10 am and I've been here since I got here. They refused any hotel services and any food vouchers, my luggage is probably lost by now. I have been flying on my own for 3 years now and have never ever had a problem like this. When I asked for a Lounge they laughed at me and told me to go sleep in the lobby.

At check in, we provided all of our necessary info and errors popped up with our flight. At first we thought it was due to our passports but the airline supervisor insisted it was their system. They just couldn't find us in the system even though we had our itinerary. She couldn't provide us a clear answer as to why we had errors in our flight. It didn't make sense since we were traveling with 4 other people going to the same destination and they went through check in just fine. We stood in line with the check in agent on the phone for 2 hours! Apparently she had to call every connecting flight we were taking. All the while she barely updated us on what was going on making us ask her for updates. All we received were $100 vouchers each for American Airline tickets that had to be used within the year. We had missed our flight and they had to rebook us for the following day. Note, our original tickets were purchased online and we paid extra money to be seated together. The rebooked tickets did not have any of our seats together! We asked the agent at the gate to please sit us together and she refused. She couldn't even try to move people around? We've taken other airlines where they happily moved people around so we could sit together and succeeded. I will never take American Airlines again!

Before touching down at LA I got sick, and somehow managed to walk to the galley and despite her restriction, the flight attendant managed to get me a bottle of water and I am grateful to her for that. The flight was 3/4 full, so I went to the two empty seats at the back and rested all the way to LA, the seats were comfortable, and the plane seemed new though some seats were worn and torn.

I was told several times that there would be not issues on the connecting flight.

Flying from or into Punta Cana, this means that we had many hours without food and with very little to drink as one is not allowed to pack anything to bring through TSA. To compound that when the Manchester flight was canceled due to fog we were left with no time to get any food either. The saving grace was that the flight attendants largely are very kind (save a few).

American Airlines,1,Shawn Flynn,10th December 2015,"As a college student that was studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and it being time to go home I was nervous that something would happen on my American Airlines return journey as I was faced with a 14 hour delay on my way there. We board the plane in Buenos Aires and was delayed because of an ill passenger who turned out was drunk. And I was getting nervous because I had to go through passport control and customs and catch my connecting flight in Miami. After getting through customs in Miami I was told that I missed my connecting flight. The only way I could make it to my final destination that wasn't in the middle of the night was to take a train to the Ft. Lauderdale airport and catch a flight to Charlotte, N.C. that would connect me to Columbus, Ohio. I went to Ft. Lauderdale and got to the counter to check in my luggage and stood at the counter for 10 minutes and the people working there just ignored me by talking among themselves or playing on their computers causing me to miss the flight to Charlotte. Finally when someone paid attention to me they were very unapologetic and I demanded either a refund or to be put on a flight that connected with Columbus ASAP. They got me on a flight to Philadelphia that connected to Columbus and thankfully I those flights ran smoothly and on time. I sent an email to AA's customer service explaining to them why I will never be using American Airlines again. I will look into a different airline for international travel and use Southwest for domestic travel.

At least American is. Fortunately for me, and the only reason I made this trip was the fare was extremely low. American Airlines charges for everything. Want to sit in the middle of the plane, thats extra. Want to watch anything on the brand new IFE devices, thats extra. Checking bags? Extra. Needless to say on this flight, the first leg was on a nearly new A321. If it was in service much more than a month I would be surprised. The flight left on time and arrived into LAX a few minutes early. One thing I can say, and I do not know if it was because the plane was new, or this particular model is outstanding, but the cabin pressurization was amazing. I had no effects at all from the flight to my normally very sensitive ears. On the return, the flight also left on time and arrived into Miami a few minutes early. I had no issues that needed dealing with, and the flight crew were all friendly. My issue with American is the fact that everything is extra.

American Airlines,1,B Denger,10th December 2015,"I was returning home from Phoenix to Long Beach this morning (8.45am flight) with American Airlines. I had priority boarding, and as I approached the flight attendant at the door, he said I would have to check my luggage because it wouldn’t fit in the overhead bin. I’m sure I had a puzzled look and was shaking my head with confusion because I was able to fit it on my previous fit in the same plane configuration. I didn’t argue with him or say a thing, but it didn’t seem right. I get to my seat, I paid an additional $25 for the extra room on an Exit aisle, and there’s a bag under the seat in front of me (where my carry-on should go). I thought maybe a previous passenger had mistakenly left it behind. So I waited until most everyone had taken their seat, and hit the Attendant light. I could see the attendant (the same one that made me check my bag) look from the front cabin to see where the light was on, and when he saw it was above me, he just rolled his eyes. Then, a couple of minutes, from behind me I hear a gruff and bothered female voice; “Do you need something?” I explained that there was a bag in front of me and that I was concerned that someone had left it by mistake. She said in the same, bothered and unfriendly voice, “That’s a crew member’s bag. Just leave it, it’s fine where it is.” During the entire time pre-flight and flight, I never saw her smile or say a pleasant thing to anyone in the main cabin. Instead of asking, “Would you like some orange juice or some coffee?”, it was “What do you want?” It’s as if we were bothering her and why did we have to be on her plane? Finally, as I was walking off the plane, the front cabin attendant was wishing those in front of me a good day, but when I walked up, he just looked at me with a dead expression. He didn’t acknowledge me at all. It’s been a while since I’ve flown AA, and I don’t remember having an unpleasant experience before. Based on this experience, from both crew members, I will avoid AA for any future flights. AA needs to do some people skills training, as there are other choices for travelers.

This was a 90th birthday surprise party for her. When she arrived at the gate escorted by my niece, she was informed that she could not carry on her luggage. This was because no American Airlines employee would be willing to lift her carry on case to the overhead bin. Her carry on case was within the size required for carry on, however, would not fit under the seat. My 90 year old mother is unable to lift items above her head. My niece was not permitted to enter the cabin of the aircraft to lift the carry on for her. My mother takes a variety on medications and could not risk the chance of losing her luggage in the stowed compartment of the aircraft. After extreme anxiety, my niece was able to purchase a $100 piece of luggage that would fit under the seat and would hold all of her things. Her case was not heavy or even filled. I contacted American Airlines customer service. After a month, American Airlines gave her a $50 flight coupon for her inconvenience. What a joke!

Once the plane arrived at 11:45 they rushed us all onboard and then sat there for 40 minutes on the tarmac.

After about another 40 minutes of sitting a few of us starting to receive emails that the flight had been canceled all together. It is sad how Orbitz sent me an email quicker than they could tell me! After a 2 hour delay and 1.5 hours on the plane they finally canceled. But it gets better! With 70 of us and 1 woman at the service desk (who was very nice and trying her best!) we were told the only options were to wait until 11pm the next day (almost a full 24 hours) for a direct flight or take a flight to Chicago and have a 6 hour layover until Hartford.

Flight delays, cancellations, horrible customer service. Besides my good judgement, I purchased 5 tickets with them. Almost immediately I realized I had made the purchase in error and called to get a refund, which I'm entitled to. I was put on hold forever, disconnected multiple times and told there would be no refund.

American Airlines,1,Hunter James,28th November 2015,"I have never had such a bad experience on a plane in my life. I was coming back to Atlanta from the Bahamas with American Airlines but I had a connecting flight through Miami. Getting onto the plane they made me check my carry-on because they had reached capacity (even though I was in the second group). I was hesitant doing so but I did as they asked. When we landed I waited for an hour and half in baggage claim before they told me where it was. They had left the bag in Miami because the plane was too heavy and couldn't carry anymore bags. (They didn't even tell me they were doing this.) The worst part was that I was going to the Auburn Alabama game in the morning and my ticket was in that bag so I had to miss the game. Also the rest of my family's bags were scuffed, one of the bags had the zipper ripped off and the pocket in the front ripped off as well. They asked if American Airlines would fix it or replace it and they refused to do either. The fact that I am actually taking the time to write this review is how angry I am.

The terminal staff were rude and arrogant. Their problems caused us to miss our connecting flight and our hotel transfer.

Not to mention that it stopped raining about an hour later. Today my flight got delayed for an hour because of a ""maintenance issue"".

The contempt that AA obviously has for its customers was quite an eye opener with not one ounce of customer service or care given at all, many of the passengers were Americans trying to get home to family for Thanksgiving. Whilst we all understand mechanical issues have to be dealt with and safety being paramount, you also need to have some level of empathy and a duty of care for your customers and there was a way AA could have dealt with a cancelled flight but they failed big time.

American Airlines,2,M Pflaum,25th November 2015,"My trip started off a little rocky. Understandably, my flight was originally delayed two hours due to a passenger being sick. From there, bad weather caused my flight to be detoured and grounded in Kansas for 1+ hours before resuming the flight to Texas. During this entire flight time, we were only served drinks once (at the very beginning of the flight), and the flight was short on food due to the previous delay due to sickness. Therefore us passengers went 7+ hours with only one beverage service, and no available food. When we landed, we were all scrambling to reach our connecting delayed flights, if they hadn't been cancelled at that point yet. Luckily, I reached my gate in time, waited an hour, before realizing people were slowly disappearing even though there had been no announcement stating my flight had been cancelled (this was at 12AM). After inquiring if my flight was in fact cancelled, I was also told that every single flight to my destination was booked the next day with no openings on any flights for over a day. Desperate, I asked how I could get closer to my destination. I was put on standby for a 1:30AM flight out, and told I could take a 2 hour bus ride to my destination in the morning. Once again, upon landing at 2:30 in the morning, we were left unable to unload for one hour because flights were backed up. I get that weather happens, but the customer service to this point was terrible, and we never once receiving anything to drink. Once when I landed, I figured I should find out where my bus would be leaving from before finding a spot on the floor to close my eyes for a few hours. I was told by an airport worker I was in the right location, so I stopped my search and found my place on the floor. Waking up an hour and fifteen minutes early, just to be sure I wasn't given the wrong information, I began questioning where this bus would exactly turn up. After talking to 5 different people and being told 5 different places I should go to catch my bus, an American Airlines employee sent me all the way across the airport to a place where my bus was not taking off from, and no one could answer any of my questions. So, I returned to American Airlines, and finally my patience was spent. I explained my story, showed them my tickets, and the employee replied that in the ten years that they had worked there, they had never seen this bus ticket option before. Then after spending ten minutes making phone calls, they realized this bus service had in fact been around for 2 years. Never once did I receive an apology for being sent all around the airport, when this could've been solved by admitting they were unsure where this bus left from and making a phone call to find out the answer. I then had a 4 hour layover at the airport, before finally boarding a bus to my final destination. Arriving 17 hours later than I should have. I understand that we can't control the weather, and things happen. My issue with this experience was the awful customer service.

This happens and I understand that. However, the way I was treated in Philly was inexcusable and the compensation was worse! First after missing my connecting flight I was told to go to Customer Service, which was a very long walk. Then there was a line with over 100 people in it, so I had to stand in line for well over 90 minutes, late at night. By 11pm, I was given a ticket for the next morning flight, no apology and no hotel. I was supposed to sleep in the airport. They would not even help me find a hotel, they gave me a phone number, in which I had to walk to a second customer service desk to use their phone and they couldn't even tell me a hotel close by to use. I called the phone number for hotels, but the quota for airline hotels was booked up by this time and I was left on my own to find a hotel, book it and pay for it. I have a disability, and I asked for a cart to help me through the airport, I was denied. The ticket girl, told me it wasn't that far to walk. Yes, it was!

After a long 4 hour delay, the airline decided to give up on any further attempts of getting us to our desired destinations.

American Airlines,1,D Evans,20th November 2015,"Having flown all over the country and flown all over the world, I have a bit of an idea of what a quality flying experience is, as well as what a bad experience is. My wife and our two toddlers had to get a flight out of San Diego to Salt Lake City via Los Angeles. She got to the airport with plenty of time, but being a Friday evening, the airport was packed. She went to check in at the kiosk, but it denied her and she had to wait in a long line to see a rep. Finally, she got to the front of the line, only to be told that she needed to go wait in another line because the counter she waited for was being closed. With two toddlers, who, thank the lord, were very well-behaved, a carry-on suitcase, and a stroller, she had to get into another line to wait all over again. By this time, her departure was getting close and she had not even gotten her ticket due to the kiosk denying her (for whatever reason) and being sent to wait again in another line. When she finally got to the ticket counter (again) the female rep told my wife that it was a waste of time to print her ticket as my wife and kids would surely miss the flight. There was still time to make the flight, but the time was running out quickly. Having no sense of courtesy, the rep began to close down her counter and handed out cards with a phone number that people would have to call to have their tickets printed. I have never seen or heard of that before. After more time was wasted at the counter, my wife began to panic, and while trying to keep my two toddlers calm, she finally convinced the rep to print her ticket. My wife rushed through security (of course having her hands inspected for whatever residue the TSA looks for), and got to the gate. The airplane was still docked, but the door was closed, thus she was denied boarding. My wife went around to a few different American Airlines desks to figure out what she could do and wasn't helped at all, rather, she was greeted with agitation, not sympathy or civility. Eventually, Alaska Airlines allowed her onto their next flight free of charge, which was a direct flight, and she made it home. However, she had to wait another several hours in the San Diego terminal with two toddlers to get onto that flight. American Airlines and their reps made my wife and two young kids miss their flight and couldn't care less. Alaska Airlines solved our crisis and didn't even charge us.

I go to customer service. The first agent said she would reroute me through Dallas but the plane was full, so I got a standby for 11hours later. I looked online and saw there were seats for another flight through Chicago and went back to request that, only arriving 3 hours late. This bored agent (not harried, there order for agents and me) said that their policy now was to when we re route through the same exact points so I was stuck on the next direct flight and could not be rerouted. But either way one of them was lying through to me. The 2nd agent refused to fly me on the much more convenient flight she just said deadpan, ""welcome to the new American Airlines."" At least I am making my flight on the much later one on a rickety old US Airways plane which are prone to frequent breakdowns, which is why I refused to fly them before. 4-6 hour delays were too common. I can always hope for a upgrade to first class, however on these planes, the first class on domestic flights is like 1985 economy deluxe.

Now that I've taken two flights on this new aircraft and spoken to flight attendants it is clear that American has chosen the wrong aircraft for this route. Firstly, although new, the setup is so flawed and poorly thought out on many levels. The entertainment system is problematic with constant reboots needed and a very clumsy operating system. The whole experience is like renting a car from a budget company and getting a new car which is clearly made as cheaply as possible. The most serious issue is that due to fuel requirements this aircraft very often has to move passengers away from the front of the aircraft when loads are light. A flight attendant confessed to me that it happens with regularity including evacuation of the entire first class cabin. This is not a safety issue but an issue of very poorly thought out choice of aircraft for route.

We got in line for a rep and waited while several angry customers ahead of us were seen to. Got to the front of the line and were told that we could not be helped and had to stand in another line for a different rep that could check our little dog in. We did this and finally 30 mins later were at the front of that line when the rep closed his station! He directed us to another line where we waited and started to fret because it was getting near to our flight time. Got to the front of that line and the sloth like rep told us our gate had closed. We asked what our options were and were told it was not her problem! My husband ran and tracked down an AA manager. He proceeded to read us the riot act about being late before even hearing our side of the story. Fortunately some other travellers who were going through similar scenarios stood up for us and told the AA manager that we had indeed been on time and had spent over 1.5hrs in the check in line. The manager decided to help us after explaining AA was in no way responsible for any of our trouble. He got us to our gate just before the plane door closed. We had paid for an upgraded seat but lost that with no compensation and not even an apology.

We cleared security at 4.15 and checked on the board that we were still for Gate C22 . The board confirmed Gate C22 and we proceeded directly there. At 4.40 an announcement was made that the gate had changed to A39 - two terminals away. By the time we got there (with quite a few others) they had closed the boarding!

Anyway, rebookings for missed connections at LHR were taken care of, and we were given new boarding cards when we got off the plane at LHR, no stress. Regarding the flights, we liked the new seat. It is very comfortable for sleeping although it could have a little more padding. Better than British Airways Club World seat in my opinion (BA is better for privacy if you are in a window seat). IFE and WiFi are very good, good movie selection and relaible WiFi (but it should be free of charge in business class, charging 17USD is borderline indecent). Food could also use a little improvement (love their ice cream sundaes though, which sadly weren't available on the inbound flight). There were no amenity bags for the MIA-LHR leg something I actually missed because I had most of my stuff in the checked baggage and I had no moisturiser at hand. Worst part of the journeys were probably ground service at Miami which left alot to be desired, staff were rude and not very helpful. Overall a good business class product that needs some minor improvements. Would book with the airline again.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LHR to LAX,November 2015,4,5,3,4,2,4,yes

The lounge attentent said it was too short a flight to allow access to the first class lounge. These types of policies are the reason I switched from this airline years ago.

American Airlines,1,Joseph Chagnon,12th November 2015,"My wife booked a flight to South Korea with one layover each way. American Airlines took it upon themselves to change her return flight schedule and add one more layover to her schedule which had a 57 minute window. When she got to her first connecting flight she was told that her flight was delayed which only allowed for 17 minutes to get her second connection which she will obviously miss. American Airlines was kind enough to make her wait all night in Chicago and fly her out at 7:15am, 10 hours later. This is the second time in a row this airline has done this. I will never fly with this company again. I don't care if I have to pay 500 dollars extra. If you buy a certain flight schedule they should have to honor your purchase.

We flew from London Heathrow to Dallas to be told our next flight to Lima was cancelled, and we were rebooked on to another flight via Los Angeles to Lima leaving 20 hours later. Also we were told the delay was due to the weather and there would be no food or drink vouchers. Between Heathrow and Lima via Dallas and LAX one of our bags went missing, due to American Airlines transferring us to another airline. They took no responsibility for the loss, even though both bags were checked in with American Airlines. Out of seven flights we took on this 12 day holiday, 5 were with American Airlines and all had delays for different reasons, totalling 27 hours.

American Airlines,1,Michael Southern,11th November 2015,"American Airlines was not a pleasant experience. It was my first and more than likely will be my last time using them. I was suppose to fly from Milwaukee to Dallas to Austin. Due to fog, we had to land in San Antonio. I can understand weather delays and the fact that it is out of the employees control. I did not appreciate however having to sit on the tarmac in San Antonio, TX for 2 plus hours. Furthermore, we were not offered any potential deal, whereas I needed to get to Austin which was closer to San Antonio. Only the people with the final destination as San Antonio were able to deplane. I could have taken a rental car to get to Austin, as it was closer to San Antonio. Instead, we had to wait 2 plus hours, fly back to Dallas and deal with it. After getting back to Dallas finally, they had only 2 concierce working a 75 plus person line. What was even more irritating was someone came down the line handing out a customer service number and basically said, this is what you will need to do. I called, was put on hold for 10 minutes and then hung up on. I called again, at which time they were able to get me on a 4:59 pm flight out of Dallas to Austin. Shocker, that flight was delayed until 6:59 p.m. and once on the runway was delayed another 20 minutes. Not once did someone say, sorry about your delay, not once was I offered an airport meal/beverage. I do not expect anyone to comp airfare, but the attitude displayed throughout the day was ""deal with it"" more or less.

I had also pre-booked the following day's return flight to Grand Turk.

We are still sitting in the airport for our flight, over 5 hours late. The worst part about it is that if it weren't for other passengers no one would have known about the delays. The women at the gate literally argued that there were no delays with people who had waited hours with no update. Leaving over 100 people scattering to change their connecting flights.

They offered no apology, vouchers for hotels, meals, a cab, and even said at the airport that we had to call reservations on our cell phones to rearrange connecting flights for the next day. As a teacher with a job I cannot miss, this was extremely inconvenient. No explanations were offered about the delay, except that the plane was arriving late from it's last location. The announcements of delays were very late, right around the 4pm scheduled departure time, well after they were informed of a delay (2:30pm, according to the national reservation office). This left no time to find alternative flights for the same day. I had to spend an hour in the lobby calling the national reservation office multiple times to check on flights from neighboring airports, even Dulles and Reagan International, several hours away, but there was no time (or vouchers for transportation) to get there.

American Airlines,1,Bob Harrison,9th November 2015,"I have been an American Airlines frequent flyer for many, many years. I don’t fly the airline nearly as much now that we have moved to Hilton Head Island, since connections from Savannah are not in general as good as for other airlines to the destinations to which we fly. Recently my wife and I took a cruise from Barcelona to Lisbon on Oceania Cruise lines on which, as part of the package, they booked us on AA for outbound flights from Savannah to Philadelphia to Barcelona. As soon as I knew our flights, I went online to select seats, and the only ones we could get were the two center seats of the middle section (seat configuration 2-4-2). As my wife really likes window seats for transatlantic flights, I attempted to change seats at the check-in desk in Philadelphia. We were then able to get the G and H (side aisle and window) seats in row 35, the last economy row aft in the airplane. That is usually fine with us - quiet and a little more room. We flew those seats on Qantas for 14 hours to New Zealand. I sat in the aisle seat. I am 5’6” tall, 148 pounds. Even at my relatively small size, my seat was so narrow that it was impossible for me for to keep my left elbow inside the seat rest, especially during sleep. Since AA continues to pack seats in the plane, even at the back where the width of the fuselage tapers (where I was sitting), the width of the aisle was only barely wide enough to let the service cart through. Seriously, it is beyond belief that AA would just cram extra seats in the back and make people uncomfortable just to make a few extra dollars. As a result, my left elbow was hit almost every time the service cart went by, for the entire flight. So, while trying to sleep, I was bumped awake all night for every transit of the flight attendant and the cart. In addition, our flight attendant was stressed, terse, harried, and rude, from the very first interaction, indicating a lack of either appropriate personnel selection or inadequate training. American Airlines in-flight meal was at best mediocre, and their free alcohol selection abysmal – they offered only beer, or cardboard-boxed wine, far below the selections of other transatlantic airlines, even those that are US-based. We flew Air France home from Lisbon through Paris to Atlanta, and then on to Savannah. Our transatlantic flight featured large, leather, comfortable seats, excellent food, flight attendants, and choice of drinks, so that I know an airline can make money and make passengers happy at the same time. My wife and I paid $1100 for the privilege of enduring this awful, cramped, uncomfortable American Airlines flight, the same price as all the other economy cabin passengers flying further forward. I have sent a letter to American Airlines about this experience and can only hope that they look at the letter seriously and improve their service, seating, and staff. If not, I hope that their current flight standard eventually generates enough negative feedback that passengers choose other carriers and they go out of business. That way their routes and traffic can be taken over by other more passenger-friendly airlines (which are virtually every other one that we have flown).",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SAV to BCN via PHL,October 2015,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,Elaine Rizzo,9th November 2015,"I have never been so disappointed in an airline. I made reservations with American Airlines months ago so that I can have the perfect flight. When I was talking to the representative on the phone I explained very clearly what I wanted, a window seat. However some time after booking our flight and before the day we were supposed to fly American Airlines changed the plane. That would not have been too bad if their email that was sent to me did not go into my Spambox. Getting ready to print our boarding passes, I saw this plane was a three seater and I had a choice of the aisle or middle seat! I wanted a window seat and made that very clear to the representative I spoke with when booking my flight. I called American Airlines and told them how upset I was and the rep said there was nothing she could do about it. I am stuck on their plane, it was impossible for me to book another flight with another airlines. When I got on the plane, I asked very quietly if I could have an extra seat belt. Well as I was walking to our seat, the staff member reach out and said Miss, here is the extra seat belt! I was so embarrassed that I wanted to drop down and hide! Really, to have someone hand you a seatbelt in front of the rest of the passengers just showed me how unprofessional American Airline employees are. I am now on this plane in the aisle and anyone that passes me, hits me! This is what I had to endure the entire flight. We finally arrive and it couldn’t be soon enough. We walk to get our luggage and no luggage! We walk to the office and find out that American Airlines chose to put our luggage on another plane. The lady behind the desk tells us in one hour your luggage will be here. You can wait or they will deliver our luggage to where we are staying! Asking again how long will that take, she said only 1 Hour! Why did I believe her - arriving in New Orleans with heels on and warmer clothes because we were coming from Washington DC on this very uncomfortable flight, we asked to have the luggage delivered to our hotel. After two hours I try calling their customer service to find my luggage. The lady tells me our luggage is at the airport waiting for a driver to deliver them.

Once airborne, refreshments were provided. Flight attendant on this particular flight in first class is nice and efficient. She took drink orders by rows. Once she served the drinks, she came back with the snack basket and offered to passengers. She came around second time taking more drink orders and offered more snack. Snack on offer was pretty good: Kettle potato chips, organic oatmeal cookies, mixed nuts, etc. I wish there were fresh food like banana and apple but what on offer was more than sufficient for the 90 minute flight. Interior of aircraft well maintained although the seat pitch in first class is a little tight. I think it is maybe 38 inches, like premium economy on other international airlines. But the American Airlines Boeing 737-800 aircraft seems to have better pitch, I think maybe 42 inches, but the four extra inches make a world of difference. A couple of minor complaints, no hot towel service and no pre departure drinks. That is maybe I chose to board the aircraft last so I don't have to sit while waiting for the other 180 passengers to board and walked by me and knock me over with the oversized suitcases. One recommendation for American Airlines is that they should enforce cabin bags regulations as many passengers are cheap and chose to bring the oversize suitcases onboard rather than paying check baggage fees.

And few tiny screens scattered in aisles that probably 50% couldn't see. No one asked once in 18 hours round trip if my 18 month infant was okay or needed anything. Except the one time a man working for American came to tell him off for clicking the attendant button. Except he didn't! It was a faulty button that kept coming on. And it was my button, not his.

American Airlines,3,Guilherme Silva,2nd November 2015,"I am a Concierge Key member on AA. I fly around 200k+ miles/year. In spite of the effort to remodel old planes American Airlines still has many old 777 in routes such as London and Madrid. But that is temporary (or so we hope). What is hard to understand is why a crew can be so unprepared and unprofessional (or at least part of it) JFK to MIA: First two flight attendants were missing. All passengers (since no preboarding was done) left on the jet bridge until somebody decided to show up (a minimum number of flight attendants is required to board a plane. So why did they start boarding ?) When the crew shows up decided to play the PA music at the loudest possible volume. Everybody in the plane complaining since we could not even talk or listen to the person seating right next. No menus. To get a glass of wine (first class and after paying $900+ for a round ticket) I had to ask three times. Asked twice to hang my coat. The flight attendant told me he was busy and could come back in a few minutes. Asked him again 5 min later. He could not care less! I gave up and carried the jacket on my lap the rest of the trip. Better than insisting with somebody that clearly is not prepared for his job. When I add this type of unprofessional service to the fact that AA charges substantially more than other Airlines on the same exact route (compare MIA-MAD on AA and on Iberia in Business for example), I wonder why I am still flying AA.

However, we had no problems whatsoever, from checking in online, dropping bags off at the airport to reaching our destinations. All four of our flights departed on time and two arrived early. The boarding was fine and the flights were either full or nearly full.

Only American Airlines could do that to 1st class and all economy passengers! Why do they have onboard baggage sizes and weights guides when it goes in the hull anyway? On the flight the FA thought it was cool to stuff food in his face and chew it while doing the safety demo.

I asked one of the stewardess (737-800 flight from DCA to ORD) how her day was going and how many flights she had today. She replied with her answer, then gave me a an entire can of Coca-Cola. Surprising considering that they aren't supposed to do that. Though $25 each way for a bag is excessive, it does beat the economy airlines.

American Airlines,3,M Erickson,26th October 2015,"I booked a flight from Paris to Columbus, with a stop in New York (JFK). Shortly after booking my ticket, I noticed that American Airlines allowed just more than an hour to make the connection. Since I would be coming into JFK on an international flight, and would need to go through customs and re-check baggage before continuing on to my connecting flight. I become concerned about the time crunch and called American Airlines to verify that I would have enough time to make the connection. They assured me that I would, so I moved forward with the planned itinerary. When I arrived into New York from Paris, I was pleased that American Airlines had sent an employee to wait for me at the gate to give me an expedited pass through customs so that I could catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately, after clearing customs, I waited for an additional 30 minutes to get my checked baggage, so that I could re-check it. I literally ran the entire way through the airport to catch my flight. I arrived at my gate exactly 9 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off, but the flight was already gone. Not only was the door shut, but the airplane was already gone from the gate. This left me wondering why American Airlines authorized a flight to leave early when not all of its passengers had arrived at the gate. I was especially disappointed since I was traveling with my wife and infant son, and we were all very tired after a long day of traveling (we began our journey the day before flying with a different airline into Paris). An American Airlines agent at the gate kindly re-booked me for a flight the next day, but informed me that I would need to wait in the check-in line in order to ask about a hotel voucher. After waiting in line and speaking with a check-in agent about a hotel voucher, I was informed that since my flight from Paris was on time, they would not give me a voucher. I explained that I had run through the airport, and that the reason I had missed my flight was because my bags did not come through for more than 30 minutes after I had cleared customs. The check-in agent seemed to feel genuinely sorry, but reiterated that he would not give me a hotel voucher. Instead, I paid $300 to get a decent hotel on short notice. It is frustrating and unfortunate that American Airlines would feel it more important to avoid additional cost than to reimburse a customer for an expense that American Airlines had caused. American Airlines made two mistakes: They authorized a flight to push off early, even though they knew they had passengers rushing from a connecting flight. They did not give a hotel voucher even though they were late in getting checked bags to the carousel, resulting in a missed flight and need for a place to stay for the night. Nobody likes to be taken advantage of when they are vulnerable. This is how American Airlines treated me and my family. For this reason, I will avoid using American Airlines in the future when possible.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Columbus via JFK,August 2015,3,3,2,2,1,3,no

Our departing flight was delayed by nearly 30 minutes, but thanks to modern unexplicable airline scheduling, we still arrived into Charlotte an hour before our connecting flight which was on time. American is really more of a no frills airline than the so called discount airlines. Both of our flights were on repainted USAir planes which had no in cabin entertainment at all, other than wifi which I did not bother to connect to. No snacks served either. Both of these planes, while clean, were definitely on the worn side. One thing I will add, is for the first time I used Americans mobile boarding pass. This can be obtained via their app or emailed. With this and not checking bags, I had absolutely no contact with any airport agents. I also slept on both flights so I had no inflight contact with flight crew.

American Airlines,1,E Middleton,19th October 2015,"I'd award American Airlines zero stars if possible. Sunday, September 21, Miami to Madrid, departure at 6:45PM with a code share on to Casablanca. At 4AM that morning, I am awakened by an automated call from AA, but with no recording - just silence. I check the web site, and the flight is delayed three hours to 9:45 PM. I get another ""mystery"" call waking me at 4:15 and another at 4:30. I shut off the phone. When our group of three gets to the gate that evening, we see the flight is further delayed to 11 PM (no explanation). We board only to find an aircraft that is beyond stuffy and hot - the temp must be in the upper 80s F (31 C). We're told the auxiliary power unit is malfunctioning, and there is a computer problem in the cockpit. By midnight, we're all soaked in sweat, and the temp we are old by an FA has reached 98 F (36 C), beyond union work rules. We're, told rather curtly, and in Spanish only, to get off the plane and wait at the gate. At 1 AM we're rushed back onto the plane. The pilot attempts to start the engines but the plane is plunged into darkness, with the emergency lighting cycling up only after about 30 seconds and the full lights not back on for five or more minutes (video never recovered). He tries this again, with the same result. Now passengers are demanding to get off. The gate agent comes on to give them a stern lecture that they will get no compensation or assistance if they leave since the plane has not been cancelled. At 2AM another attempt is made to start the engines, to no avail. Darkness, then chimes, then emergency lighting. All the while, the plane feels like a Hot Yoga tube. ""Folks,"" the captain said ""if we can just get the engines started we'll be just fine."" At 3 AM, the captain announces the flight is cancelled due to the failure of multiple APUs and FAA crew rules. Chaos reigns at the gate as there is no help with rebooking and announcements are in Spanish. At 3:45 we get our paperwork from the surly agent for the Iberia flight the next day at 5PM. We show up at 1PM only to be told by Iberia, a OneWorld ""partner"", that AA had not properly booked my seat nor endorsed the ticket over properly. (My friends were OK). I spent the next hour and a half running back and forth between the two airlines - they are about 1/3 a mile apart - while AA produced paper ""tickets"" that Iberia would not accept. ""These people are stupid!"" the Iberia guy complained - a helpful, competent, friendly soul so unlike the demonically possessed AA people. He writes down the instructions instructions for the AA idiots (with exclamation marks, no less) and I get the documents 40 minutes before boarding. By now all the seats are gone and I'm on standby. I do get on the Iberia plane - last seat - but after much stress and drama and a wasted $200 a night hotel room in Morocco, which AA will not reimburse. (An EU airline would).

American Airlines,3,A Decaro,19th October 2015,"Bradley to Kansas City via Philadelphia. More than a little disappointed with American Airlines. First problem was the sitting arrangement upon ordering tickets online, we were forced to pay a higher fee for premium economy because we did not choose seating the day of original purchase - traveling with a 3 yr old and none of the open seats were next to each other, therefore we were hopeful that we could speak with someone prior to selecting seats to ensure my husband or I were seated next to our child, which we did get but had to pay the extra fee for the premium economy to ensure this. Where the tray table was broken and literally flopped down entirely into my lap and the seat was loose and sliding around under my rear. During our flight from BDL to Philly, our daughter (3 yrs old) had to use the restroom, my husband went to take her and was told by the flight attendant that they had to immediately return to their seats as we were descending and could no longer be up and about - those who have young children should understand, you cannot just tell a 3 yr old child to ""hold it"". What was further infuriating about this scenerio was that we were actually 30 minutes from descending and other passengers were continuing to be up and about to and from the restroom for another 15 minutes after this happened, yet my child was not allowed to go! I have no issues with the safety and rules of an airline but if you are going to tell one person to return to their seat then shouldn't this apply to all passengers?!? Our connecting flight from Philly to MCI wasn't any better, 45 minutes sitting on the tarmac due to delays made our 3 hour and 4 minute flight even longer.

All the more confusing as American Airlines allocated seat to us for the 2nd leg of the journey from JFK to Miami. Confused - we are ! We are offered the chance to pre book online for $30 per seat (what is this scam ?) but impolitely decline after spending a whole day online trying to sort it out. So just to be clear - the first part we have to pay for seats but the connecting flight we had seats allocated by American Airlines (at no cost). On the 2nd leg to Miami from JFK we are warned that, as per usual (in our experience on US domestic flights), there is a massive overbooking of cabin luggage and not enough space. As usual passengers refuse to give up their right to take endless pieces of baggage on with them so there is delay while ground staff literally confiscate baggage to put in the hold. Truly the indignation of tight fisted travellers with totally unrealistic expectations is a sight to behold. Everyone expects to get 2 pieces on board, regardless. No more internal flights for me, thank you. From now on it's British Airways or Virgin and damn the cost. The return flight (direct from Miami to JFK) - is it too much to expect that on a 10 hour flight we might get some inflight entertainment (and I don't mean 1 film). Truly pitiful. We board on the third group (not the last group) and guess what - no overhead locker space. Getting tired of this experience now. US airlines really have to sort this out and impose realistic expectations on their customers. Food average for economy, except the coffee which was really awful (I'm no coffee snob but how can you get this wrong American Airlines?) Cabin crew were okay to rude (congrats to the the one lady that really made the effort, on the other side of the plane).

I was forced to pay extra for a seat on my flight when I had booked the ticket a month in advance and checked in 24 hours prior to my flight. When I got to the airport, still no seats were available and the employee was less than helpful in offering another solution. Once I got to my ""upgraded"" seat, I found that I had no extra room, the armrest was broken and so was the tray table. The flight attendants and airport staff had zero personality and were not very friendly. I will do everything in my power to not fly with American Airlines in the future. To top it off, the only way to get in touch with customer service to file a complaint is via email. The representative who responded had no sympathy and basically told me to kick rocks. I was unable to respond to the message because it was sent from an unspecified email address. The worst customer service I have experienced possibly ever.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to RDU,October 2015,1,2,1,1,1,2,no
American Airlines,1,Iain Lawrie,16th October 2015,"Don't fly with American Airlines! Having booked our business class flight with British Airways we had to use American Airlines from LAX to Honolulu. We had a 6 hour wait in LAX for our ongoing flight so decided to use the American Airlines lounge. Fat chance! We were refused entry as we weren't members! Even after explaining that we were flying business class we were told we were not allowed in. Having flown all round the world over the last 20 years many times in business class, we have always had access to lounges. Not according to the American Airlines agent! So after biting our tongues, we eventually got onto the flight to Hawaii. What fun. The cabin service manager was rude and obnoxious. The food was the worst we have ever had, even flying economy. Even telling the Cabin Manager about the food, all she did was pick up the tray and make no comment. There was a young Hawaiian hostess who was sweet and smiled at everyone. So what was the problem with her boss? The seats were uncomfortable even though they were supposedly First Class. We had made the mistake of having front row 1D and 1F and we were so close to the bulkhead we couldn't stretch our legs. Don't have bulkhead seats! Return flight to LAX we changed our seats to non bulkhead which helped with the legroom. Went into the AA lounge in LAX and were greeted nicely and given access. We then asked why we were refused entry before, only to be told that it was a mistake as we had the right to use the lounge! We should have asked to see a supervisor to check our status! Pity they put untrained staff in a business lounge. Having got entry into a lovely quiet and spacious lounge we were disappointed to find a total lack of food except to crackers and cheese. We had been given 3 drink vouchers each so we could get something to drink. Why is it that other airlines give you no restriction on drinks? The next flight was from LAX to LHR on a new Boeing 787. Nice plane and nice business class seats. Hostess were quite attentive but again totally let down by the quality of the food unless you like over cooked steak for dinner and leather scrambled eggs for breakfast! Why is it other airlines can get things right but American Airlines have grumpy staff and absolutely terrible food?",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LAX to Honolulu,October 2015,2,1,1,4,1,2,no
American Airlines,8,L Sloper,14th October 2015,"London to Los Angeles return with American Airlines. Flights were both on time, planes were clean and comfortable. The IFE was extensive and up-to-date. The food on the LAX-LHR route was good, although the red-eye return haul had a breakfast that I mostly left. When flying into LAX the boarding was a little chaotic - whilst Group 1 boarding were announced, after this no information was given, leaving the rest of us to guess when we went to board. On the flight itself, crew were friendly at first but after about 2-3 hours into the flight they clearly were tired and it reflected on their manner as I felt like I was irritating them every time I asked for a drink when they came down the aisles, which did feel a little intimidating to me. Thankfully, my flight back was much better organised in boarding and crew were very friendly throughout the flight.

American Airlines,1,J McDonald,13th October 2015,"Will never fly AA again. I was scheduled on a 4pm flight from Sacramento to LAX on Saturday, Oct. 11th. I arrived at 2pm for the flight. It was marked as 'delayed' and re-scheduled for 5:45pm departure. At about 5pm I moved my seat closer to the gate counter to listen to the staff conversation about updates. They had probably a dozen conversations with maintenance people, pilots, etc all in hushed tones to one another. Then, when someone would approach the staff, they would rudely say 'we know nothing - you'll have to sit back down and wait'. Super rude to nearly every person who approached to ask. At 7.30pm - after only 1 announcement over a speaker about what is happening, they canceled the flight. A long line of people had been waiting to talk to gate attendants for the last several hours, but most of the attendants were just beyond rude - no information, wouldn't look at people, just kept typing away for hours with nothing actually happening. We run down to the ticketing booths to get our flights re-booked. Of course, by this time there were no other flights to LAX that night. Again, if people had known an hour earlier that the chances were unlikely that they would get to LAX that night, they would have tried to get on another flight. As I wait in line I re-book a flight over the phone in 5 minutes. However, I then need a hotel voucher, as my flight left at 7am. After waiting in line at the ticketing booth for 2.5 hours someone finally provided vouchers to everyone waiting. 7After waiting for hotel shuttle to arrive for 45 minutes, a group of us finally pay for a cab to the hotel. We walk in at 10pm and the lone hotel staffer has no idea that we were coming, and also has no idea what airline vouchers are. They also only have 4 rooms available. As our group finally gets rooms a large group arrives from our plane with vouchers in hand, only to be told there were no rooms available. I'm guessing these people, after spending 8 hours waiting, just went back to the airport to sleep. Again - things happen, planes get delayed/canceled by nobody's fault. However if the staff had been remotely professional and fore-thinking, they could have got people with important connections on other flights before it was too late. The staff could have communicated at least a few times over the course of hours to everyone, helping to alleviate the confusion and hysteria that grew out of knowing NOTHING.

American Airlines,1,S Gil,13th October 2015,"Booked two flights online to Chicago at $300 more per ticket than several other airlines because we had a gift certificate we wanted to use. While trying to select our seats, the only seats showing available cost an extra $58 per seat. I called AA and the 'customer service' representative informed me that she could make the seat selection for me, but that would cost an extra $25 per seat. I explained that I was requesting assistance because their website wasn't allowing me to make my selection. She said the only way she could help me without an extra charge was to transfer me to their technical assistance department and, if that person there could not help me, he/she could transfer me back to 'customer service' and authorize a waiver. Then, they could make my seat selection without charging me extra. The person at the technical assistance desk informed me that there were seats available at the quoted price, but that I had to complete my purchase, and select my seats 30 minutes afterward. It actually took eight hours to receive a confirmation, and I still could not make a seat selection. Once again I called 'customer service' and the rep informed me that the only way I could select my seats was to pay an additional $25 dollars per reservation. Otherwise, I needed to wait until the day of departure in order to be assigned seats at the gate. They could not even guarantee that we would be seated together. In light of the ridiculous two-day process of trying to get assigned seating, I asked to speak to a supervisor but was refused any assistance, refused to give me her employee ID (finally gave in after five or six requests), and refused to put me in contact with her supervisor. This is the first and last time I will fly American Airlines. Their flights are over priced and, based on their pathetic lack of any regard for the customer, their staff is over paid.

American Airlines,1,Ankit Bhageria,13th October 2015,"I had a pathetic experience travelling American Airlines from London to Miami and back from Chicago to London. They don't just have issues on one or two fronts but multiple ones. Being Indian, I am not used to great customer service but the flight attendants in American Airlines put the ones on Air India to shame. They are rude and do not care about your needs. The entertainment system is the worst and their fleet is so old that the screen size could be trumped by some of the bigger phones in the market. There were a total of 10 movies on the plane and the choices were pathetic. The entertainment system is not personalized and they have shows running like in a cinema hall. So if you miss the show start, you join in between. The food was another issue. I had specifically asked for a AVML (Asian Vegetarian Meal) and they told me that they 'call' it VGML (Vegetarian Meal). Nobody from American told me that it is a simple vanilla vegetarian meal consisting of bread, butter, crackers and pasta when I was expecting some food I am used to. I had called American thrice to confirm this and they told me I am all set. While I was slated to fly back from Chicago, the aircraft developed brake issues and they had to install new ones. This delayed departure by four hours. Every one hour, American would announce that they will tell us soon but even after boarding, we could not take off for 1.5 hours.

American Airlines,1,V Samuel,11th October 2015,"Today is 7 Oct and wife and I are not in Dominica! Long story, and very sad - we awoke this morning at 2:30 to get the last of the things done around the house necessary to close it for the 6 months we would spend in Dominica. About 3:45 AM, a buddy of mine showed up to take us to the airport. We got to Eppley Airport about 4:30 and had boarding passes about 15 minutes later. Went thru TSA in a breeze – best TSA screening ever for us – very quick. We walked to the departure gate and found a place to sit next to the gate work area. There was activity that early as a flight to Dallas was just before ours. The Dallas flight departed and our flight departure was suddenly changed from 6:05 to 6:59! What gives – no American Airlines rep at the gate would say anything. The only announcement they made was that the crew would be there shortly (25 minutes) (already post departure time). Lynn went to the gate folks and inquired about the flight, particularly because we had a connecting flight in Chicago to SJU. “No Problem” says the guy at the gate – the other flight is late, too, so all is well. You will have plenty of time. Our flight finally boards and departs – well over an hour late. In flight, the pilot announces that the delay was as a result of “crew rest time” as the original crew for this flight got in late the evening before. We get to Chicago, go like hell to the gate for the SJU flight and get there just in time to see the aircraft preparing to pull away from the terminal. We were not allowed to board as the “door” closed 10 minutes before we got there. At that point, one of the AA reps hands us boarding passes for the next flight to SJU – several hours later. I ask “how about the connecting flight following that one?” Big blank stare, a look of shock on the guy’s face – he never looked to see if there was anything else on our itinerary. Now there is a supervisor involved, both banging away on the keyboards - they have nothing for today as there is only one AA sponsored flight a day into Dominica (DOM). Finally, out of the goodness of their hearts, they offer to put us up in San Juan for the night – but the catch is that the next available seats on Seaborne (AA affiliate) to Dominica are on 15 Oct 2015 – a week away and they want us to sit in SJU waiting on the AA sponsored flight - then they offer to let us sit in Chicago! I was not happy. It was not our fault that the flight crew was so late getting us out of Omaha. We finally got new ticket vouchers for 15 Oct on the same set of flights as originally set up by Liberty Travel. One small point, our luggage is now missing in action – AA has no idea where it is – they are hunting. And the luggage cost me $50 for this mess. I hope it enjoys the trip. Later, when putting in a “claim” for our AWOL baggage, I find out from an AA employee that AA had no idea the crew was out of flying time and could not even find them in the morning? Had to have the hotel get them. At least that was the story from the ground crew personnel we talked to about the flight.

When we landed I was told to call American Airlines two days before we left to change seats if they were available. I was told I could do it online. There website is a nightmare. Dis functional and impossible to use if you have an issue. It's impossible to email a representative. The list of questions they want is irrational. The site shut down and crashed on me because it wanted information I didn't have. I was unable to get information on seat upgrades. Then I called them and spent 45 minutes of my vacation on hold. Only to find out that.(this was on top of the 45 minutes I spent when we landed. I tried to upgrade the seats then but was told I needed to wait till two days before we left) so here I am on hold for an hour two days before we leave and they tell me that they cant help me and can't do anything because the seats were booked at an undisclosed rate. They eventually helped me and scheduled a gentleman to call me. This process took 2-3 hours on the phone and a scheduled call two days later.

After trying to find a flight to get us home, I booked one with Southwest (who I've never had issues with, props to them), and asked for a partial refund of the flight I wasn't taking with them. They refused. Gave me the run around with customer relations, then got told to request a partial refund with the refunds department, which I did, and then all my flights were canceled. I was then forced to rebook my trip at a higher cost of course. All the while, the admitted that their refunds department should not have canceled my flights. This trip ended up costing me almost $1000 more than my original booking. They didn't care. I waited until I returned from my trip to request again the money I'm out. After writing 6 letters to the top 6 executives with AA, I once again received a customer relations email (auto-response) that tells me I again, won't be granted a refund.

I understand the American employees staffed at O'Hare were not to blame for the delay, but it would have been nice to recognize the delay was a huge inconvenience. Two days later, I received an email from American, asking me to review my flight from O'Hare to BWI. It was laughable. They couldn't even get my itinerary correct to review.

American Airlines,1,Jonas Ladekjaer,2nd October 2015,"My flight from JFK to CVG was continuously delayed, then cancelled, then reinstated, then delayed and then we finally got on. After 8+ hours they still didn't manage to get my bag on board, and no bagage service agent was to be found at CVG. Called 800 number, talked to an agent who promised it would be there the following day at noon.. Called to confirm today, AA didn't even have a flight coming in before 5, and the claim was never even registered with the company! Trying to have the bag flown from JFK to CVG is proving to be even more of a hassle than waiting 8+ hours. No one can help, and are giving us attitude as we are trying to be very understanding - ie. driving the hour from our house to go pick the bag up ourselves at CVG. I can't explain the situation to the point of understanding, but I will never fly American Airlines again in my life if I can avoid it. Sure the flight was cheap, and I now understand why. I have never encountered such unprofessionalism in a big airline, and I will do my best to spread the word.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CPH to CVG via LHR / JFK,October 2015,3,3,3,3,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,William Hampton,30th September 2015,"I was visiting Miami for an academic conference. My colleagues arrived to MIA a bit late due to traffic issues/flooding. We arrived to the airport around 55 min before our departure on AA1265 to PHL. With no bags to check, we proceeded to security where I noticed that my boarding pass would not load on either the mobile app nor via the browser. I told my colleagues to go through security without me, and went to a nearby American Airlines kiosk to print my ticket. It did not work. I tried another kiosk which printed an error ticket, directing me to the counter. I did check-in from home earlier that day and had a reserved seat on this flight. Aware of the lack of time, I informed the check-in line rep of the situation, who referred me to the supervisor. She understood my situation but insisted I wait in the bag check line to print my ticket, despite 0 bags to check. When I said the delay would cause me to miss my flight she unsympathetically told me that I should have arrived 2 hrs early and walked away dismissively. At the counter, the agent printed my ticket easily with no explanation as to why it didn't work on my phone or from the kiosk. I went through security and sprinted to my gate, only to miss it by a few moments (walkway still attached), both of my colleagues aboard. Rebooking was apathetic and booked me standby for 7am.

They do not want to be held responsible for any part of your flight experience which they did not provide well - which for me, was just about every one. The mechanics of the plane, quality of the flight attendant service, timeliness of the flight, etc. My son was smacked with the tray table from the seat in front of me repeatedly and no one cared to do anything about it. I finally just left it open so it could stop randomly falling on my infant (3 months old at the time). The flight attendant got annoyed and said I had to close it and I told her I would just as soon as she figured out how to get it to stop hurting my baby. She was rude and said she didn't know and didn't even apologize. Clearly, all they care about is taking your from Destination A to B, regardless if you get there in one piece or not. If you get on the plane, then they have done their job, according to them.

There allotment of hotels was out so I guess I was supposed to sleep in the airport, and some did. They would not help find a hotel, I was denied help when asking for transportation through the airport due to a disability. I ended up finding a hotel nearby and grabbing hotel transport. I was charged $172 for the night. After contacting customer service, in the end they gave me 10,000 points (which is worthless) and $79 towards my hotel. Thanks for nothing.

Used the British Airways lounge, and it was fine for a coffee and afternoon tea. Boarding at LHR chaotic. Onboard, the crew were friendly and jovial, the new Business Class seat is comfy, lots of storage, great IFE and Bose headsets. Wifi did dropout numerous times. The dining was second to none, compared to British Airways where a tray is thrown at you in Club World and the main course in overcooked and swimming in liquid.

Food absolutely terrible, especially on return leg to UK. Really cold on the flights. Our return flight was over the Atlantic when a warning light came on and the Captain returned to JFK. You could hear the alarm screeching in the background of his speech to the passengers. Escorted to stand by Fire Service after brakes checked. Second worst landing I have ever had in 45 years of flying. The landing in the replacement plane by the same pilot was only marginally better. The airline industry has moved on, especially the Middle East carriers, but American Airlines has not. I paid more for these 6/7 hour flights than I do for 14 hour flights to Asia.

Fine print seems to be what American Airlines is all about with its loyalty program. We booked a multi-city trip with up to 8 days in a layover with our AA Advantage card, expecting to be charged for baggage on our international legs of the flight. But since we have the AA Advantage card, the domestic check is supposed to be free for the first bag for each person, up to 4, on the reservation. Well, American Airlines charged us for checked bags at every point. The agents claimed that we would have to call Customer Service to get reimbursed. Customer Service said that they could not do anything, so we have to go to the online site and leave a complaint. The American Airlines representative left a terse email stating that since all our flights were booked on the same itinerary, which included an international leg, we had to pay for checked baggage on every flight. We flew to 4 different cities in the US over the space of 2.5 weeks and were charged every time for baggage. What is supposed to be a benefit of our card that charges a $95 annual fee! So American is saying that we need to divide our travel reservation into international and domestic portions when purchasing our tickets in order to enjoy a complementary checked bag.

I had concerns when received an email from American Airlines advising of 45 minute changeover, I sent several emails advising of concern, their response was to request I call them in USA. I find it strange that a company that you are paying good money to, contacts you by one option but then you have to contact them by another, I feel this needs to be addressed, I never in the end used the phone as I have had to do this with other airlines wasting time and money and just hoped all would work out. Checked in at Las vegas 3 hours before flight and was told there was no Business Lounge for American Airlines, strange as their main competitor has one and there are other lounges which you can pay to go into, why does AA not do this? The internal flight to LAX was ok, plenty of legroom in Business seats with some recline, we were provided with a bag of chips and a drink. Changeover at LAX was very efficient, arrived at gate next to where we had to get our plane to LHR, arrived with 10 minutes until boarding started. Boarded plane with no greeting from cabin staff they seemed to be engaged in conversation with each other, this caused issues when seating as my wife had to go all the way back to the front. Seat was a great set up, same as Cathay Pacific. Good seat storage, good choice of movies on large screen and comfortable seat and bed, although those over 6 foot might find ther feet feel restricted with limited foot space when in lie flat mode. Cabin staff were efficient and professional although they were not vey welcoming and did not smile - I managed after many contacts to get a smile from a hostess, but it seems to me that most do not want to be doing this job? It is strange that American Airlines would not choose to focus more on customer service especially as this is their new flagship plane. Suitcaes arrived at detination which was good.

This encourages you to pay extra so you can sit together on a long flight. I am suspicious that they do this deliberately, and if so, this is a particularly cheap and dirty trick. Also, we were placed in the rearmost row, meaning you get no choice of meal when they run out of one meal option. When I asked if this is going to happen for every meal for the whole flight, the attendant was rude and said, of course - hadn't I ever flown before? An apology would have sufficed.

On both occasions I felt that staff interaction with me was simply in bad taste. On this most recent flight from Palm Beach to Dallas Ft Worth, I was delayed by staff at the counter because he wasn't sure about how to proceed with a passenger with an international destination. As soon as I told him my final destination was Cambodia, the look that came over face told me things might get bumpy (mind you this is in South Florida and they probably don't even know where Cambodia is). Nevertheless, after looking at my passport, he felt the need to get his manager. She comes out and tells me my visa is expired. Indeed, it was expired but she was looking at my Vietnamese visa. At this point I'm upset because I'm thinking, why are these people trying to stop me from getting on this flight? They were acting as if I just woke up that morning and decided I wanted to leave the country. I finally explained to the manager that American citizens can get a visa-on-arrival once they arrive in Cambodia. After she check on the internet to confirm, she issued my boarding pass and let me be on my way. The international leg of the trip from Dallas/Ft Worth was handled by Qatar Airways (who I love) so did we really need to go through all that? Back in 2012 I was sitting in First class and just before take-off, the attendant serving the first-class cabin comes to me, of all people, and asks “Where are you supposed to be sitting”?

We expressed concern about making our connecting flight, they told us it would be fine. It was not fine, we missed the flight, we landed at 7:00 am in Dallas, the flight was scheduled for a 7:05am take off, they left early at 6:58am. We were sent to 3 different gates trying to get on flights, had to rush with our bags all over the airport and finally had to settle for flying into Reagan rather than BWI where our car was. We agreed to this because the 2 women working with us said the airline would reimburse us the $55 shuttle ride if we wrote to them,. We were not offered a voucher for food at the airport or for a shuttle like we saw other customers being offered. I was just informed by customer service that they will not reimburse as it is not their policy, but they did try to give us two $100 vouchers to use on a future flight. If I was going to fly anywhere within the 1 year they give us to use them, I would not be doing it with American Airlines and $100 will not get you far with their prices. Do yourself a favor and go with a different airline. On top of all this they will put you in the oldest plane they can find for a 7 plus hour trip to and from Hawaii, and no WiFi of course.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BWI to HNL via DFW,September 2015,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Birmingham to JFK was a new flight started in May 2015 and they must have taken this plane from the scrap heap. They boarded us on time but sat us on the plane for 2 hours - nothing offered. Finally get going and actually make up a bit of time but then waited on tarmac at JFK for another 1.5hrs. Did we have to rush to get a connecting flight to Orlando. Security at JFK is a nightmare and we got on plane with minutes to spare. Closed the door, taxi out but then everything stopped and sat for another 1.5hrs.

I arrive to my business class seat with my daughter, it felt like we were on a flight in a third world country and instead of the screen being behind the seat, I was given an old, breaking tablet with some blue tape wrap around the charger (Photo), which cause the tablet to be almost dead throughout this flight. Next we have the bathroom, which I will say is the worst! It was so tight and dirty. The food was disgusting and sloppy (Photo). The seat in front of me, the trim was lifting and not even attach to the seat(Photo). Where I was seating exactly, the air vent was without the turning knob to adjust - just 2 holes!

American Airlines,1,J Burnam,16th September 2015,"I am totally fed up with American Airlines. AA1021 departed Las Vegas without incident and on time. The flight to Dallas/Ft. Worth is only about 2 hours. The A320 can easily fly for over 4 hours. While over Wichita Falls, the pilot announces that he is low on fuel and has to divert to Wichita Falls. Later, the pilot comes over the intercom and tries to explain that it is because of weather around Dallas. Savvy passengers on the flight check this and find there are no current delays at DFW. Why does he not have enough reserve fuel? Maybe the FAA should look into this. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight to Richmond from Dallas. American Airlines had only 2 customer service reps to process about 125 angry passengers. It was after midnight when we got our new airlines tickets for our continuing flight. Our flight was 9:30AM the next day. American Airlines offered us a hotel, but at our own expense. No food vouchers were ever offered. American Airlines left us stranded waiting for our next flight. This was not the passengers fault. Just saying sorry just doesn't hack it. So this is the new American Airlines?

American Airlines,4,R Simon,16th September 2015,"Minneapolis to Chicago on American Airlines, in Economy class on a vintage MD80. Friendly check-in, where the agent worked with me to avoid the USD 100 surcharge because my hold luggage was initially 8 lbs over American Airlines 50 lbs. limit. This was appreciated. After that the experience became distinctly mediocre. Once boarding was completed the pilot announced that there will be delay due to a maintenance issue that they have not been aware of before. So a packed plane waited for the maintenance issue to be solved, which thankfully “only” lasted 40 minutes. Plane has obviously not been cleaned in MSP, as the seat pocket was full of stuff including used tissues and something sticky and disgusting. Otherwise the flight was uneventful. Legroom was ok due to Economy ExtrAA seats, but service was very average. Flight attendants not exactly unpleasant, but not particularly friendly, either and not doing more than the absolute minimum. No snacks were served (also not expected as this being the US and the flight time was below 90 minutes). Drink service was limited to coffee, water and orange juice, which is pretty poor for a flight of this duration. Bags out fast in ORD with priority bags first. In general the flight as such was OK. Pretty much like taking a bus. However, due to the delay a lot of people were very anxious to reach their connection out of ORD. The only assistance from American Airlines staff seemed to be an announcement to “remain seated, if you do not have a transfer connection to catch”. Sorry state of affairs in the US skies, but American Airlines is still my default airline for domestic flights, as staff normally seem to be willing to assist, if help is needed.",MD80,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MSP to ORD,July 2015,4,3,1,,5,3,yes

However, we were very disappointed with American Airlines service. The flight was delayed from leaving the gate due to a paperwork issue, but the cabin attendants did not do anything to ease our discomfort (the plane was getting hot due to reduced air con while still at the gate). After we got airbourne (2 hours late) the trolley came around with refreshments, but most food items had sold out completely (only nuts or chips remained). We were seated mid aircraft so feel there was never anywhere near enough food in their stock for this 6 hour flight.

We usually don't care about the food on the plane, we don't wait to fly to get a good meal, but on the flight from Kona to Lax when asked if ""pizza"" was ok, my husband asked what was the other choice and the answer was ""pizza only""!

It doesn't make any sense to fly over my city just to get back to my city and add four hours. I accepted it and moved on. The reason why I am writing this review is because I arrived at Ft Worth about 15 minutes later than the flight expected. things happen, and I understand that. But when I arrived I almost immediately heard my name over the intercom for a final boarding call to Pensacola. I was told I had 10 minutes to reach the gate or I wouldn't make it. I made it to the gate I was instructed to reach in less than 3 mins. It was the wrong gate. They told me the incorrect gate both on the plane and over the intercom. SO when I finally found airport staff they told me the correct gate. Luckily it was just a few down. I got to it with more than five minutes to spare in my 10 minute time I was given. I walked up to three personnel from American Airlines and they didn't even want to break out of their personal conversation to help me. When I said ""I heard my name, I'm here to get on"" they told me they had just closed the gate and that I would need to be re-booked. The girl who locked me out of the flight didn't even want to help me get re-booked. She pawned it off to another employee as if it was a chore. He didn't even look me in the face the entire time and told me that I would need to fly at 8.30 that night if I wanted to fly today. I asked how to file a complaint. All he said was ""go online"".

American Airlines,1,Tony Funchess,12th September 2015,"Typically American Airlines is my preferred airline, but now that I have had to work with their customer service department I question whether I will ever fly with them again. I was issued a voucher a year ago and it says redeemable at the ticket counter or by calling. As the expiration date approached I contacted them a few days before it expired to inquire about extending it. They said no. This was fine. I located a flight and booked it and then called again (September 2nd) to ""purchase"" the flight. At this point I was informed that I needed to begin my travel on that day or else lose the voucher. This travel requirement had not been previously communicated. Also, I was told they needed 2 weeks processing time so the voucher was no longer any good since I was not able to travel immediately. Had I known I needed to travel by a specific date I would have. If I knew that I needed two weeks to allow them to process the voucher (via mail) I would have gone to the airport directly. The vouchers do not come with these instructions. So I have used their poor website tools to communicate. First, I ""emailed"" customer service with no reply. Second, inadvertently I ""emailed"" ""customer relations"" (who knew they were different?). This second communication got things moving. I was told we have no record of the first email. So I| sent them the tracking number, to which the replied basically, ""oh yea, it's expired. Nothing we can do. Sorry. Keep flying with us though"". I have since resubmitted an ""email"" to them via their website.

This is their A320 shuttle between LAX-JFK, replacing larger Boeing 767, which I used to fly. It cannot be compared. Seats are great, comfortable. The only illogical thing is USB / Headphone plugs and cell phones which is behind your seat, to make space in front. But it is a little annoyance. Food is great, better than on international AA flights I take from LAX-LHR. They had great starters, good wines and fresher food options. AVOD great, good sized personal TV.

Other airlines notify customers of changes. On top of that, the rep at the counter was extremely unhelpful and booked me on a flight that I told him wasn't going to work.

I can't believe I chose them for my round trip, too. Some staff were nice, but many were rude. In fact, there was a front desk agent who was on his phone the whole time while I needed to get my flight changed. Every time I asked a question, he would answer like he was offended and I'm known to be one of the most polite people out there. He has basically inspired me to write this review. The only reason why they're not a flat out 0/10 is because there was one woman who found my wallet, came back all the way just as I was about to board my flight.

American Airlines,6,Jerry Bolton,10th September 2015,"La Paz to London via Miami. The main reason for this review is that American Airlines now check your baggage through.

I had minimal time in (Dallas on the way out) Miami and AA reservations confirmed that baggage could not be checked through. They now do so and I made the LHR flight with about 30 minutes to spare (unhelpful immigration staff). The flights were uneventful and unimpressive, but cheap and got there in reasonable time. The only real gripe is the entertainment system. The Boeing 777 flights provide a woefully short number of films, documentaries, comedies, dramas and any choice would get a 'you want to watch it from 20 minutes in or wait for the next one in 10 minutes?' Sound and picture quality are very poor. The Boeing 757 flight from La Paz was a throwback to the 80's - fold down screens in the aisle, where you will watch the only showing, unless you're sitting in a window seat and you can't see the screen anyway. Point I did like was that, for a cheap cost, you can buy a better seat well in advance.

Aside from the fact that he did not know or ask my departure time or flight number or anything else before lecturing me and the whole area was not busy at all, he was just delaying me while doing the check-in. All officious, surly and completely unwarranted. I finished check-in, went through TSA within 15 minutes and still had more than one hour left to wait at the gate before boarding started.

As I boarded my plane, we were told that we would have to sit there for another 45 minutes because LAX was under construction and was not ready for us to arrive at our estimated time. This made my connection now only 25 minutes before departure of my Denver flight, but again I was reassured by staff that this would not be an issue. Upon arrival at 9pm (25 minutes before departure of next flight) the pilot informed us that even though they were aware there were many who needed to run to their connecting flight, we were unable to get off. By the time we got off the plane and ran next door to our gate, American Airlines flight to Denver had already closed the door. I ran to the staff member right away as I was only a minute or two behind the designated ""door closing"" time and was rudely dismissed and told there was nothing that could be done. After waiting 20 minutes, a member came and helped me reschedule my flight for the next morning at 6.30am. Seeing as it was 9.30 pm, I would need accommodation for the night. American Airlines offered zero help with accommodation. In result, seeing as my flight was very early in the morning and I needed to be there the night before, I had to stay at a hotel close by. I contacted AA about this issue, but my complaint and request for reimbursement was dismissed.

American Airlines,1,Sharon Thomas,1st September 2015,"After boarding the American Airlines flight, we were kept on the plane, sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours. There were vague updates every 45 minutes and the flight attendants knew nothing about what the hold-up was. We were told that something minor had to be fixed and then were told that paperwork was being wrapped up but we had to wait another 45-60 minutes for this. Whenever the flight crew made an announcement, it didn't sound like they really knew what was going on. To top off the fact that they kept us trapped on the plane for that long, the flight attendant only came around one time to give us one small glass of water. Then 1.5 hrs after we took off, they offered us another glass of a complimentary beverage (after we took off the plane felt very stable in the air but apparently the pilot ordered that beverage service not start for a long period of time - no reason was provided). Overall, the way American Airlines crew handled this situation was very disappointing. They came off as incompetent.

Once there, just over half an hour later they informed us that the problem was solved but they had to consult with Dallas if the flight crew could conduct in question or not. Minutes later, they told us that regrettably could not make the trip and moved all the passengers to a hotel with expenses paid. Moreover, we confirmed that the flight would leave the next day at 9:00 AM and we had to be at the airport at 6:00 am in order to embark. What is our surprise now, in the hotel where we are staying, they have been placed for a notice explaining that the flight will start tomorrow at 9:00 PM by decision of the pilot.

American Airlines,6,L Williams,29th August 2015,"Paris CDG to New York JFK I only flew American Airlines because all of the one-stop flights from Cairo to New York via Qatar Airways were full, and I figured that one transatlantic flight on American Airlines was worth it to experience Qatar Airways business class between Doha and CDG. Boarding was slightly problematic. They announced business class boarding, and when I walked up to go through, I was rudely told that only business class passengers were boarding. It was assumed that due to my appearance that I couldn't possibly be a business class passenger, but once they realized the mistake, no apology was forthcoming. The plane was obviously old and the IFE personal entertainment screen was small, with a very limited selection of movies and television shows. When ""The Good Wife"" is the most interesting series available, there's a problem. However, the seat worked, and the flight attendants were nice, even though they didn't go the extra mile- everyone had to take care of their own carry-on and put it in the overhead bin. My special Halal meal was great, for both the main course and snack selectio"". My main course was similar to everyone else's in terms of presentation, but my snack was even better - instead of the Croque Monsieur Sandwich or Thai sandwich that the other passengers got, I got an awesome shrimp dish.

American Airlines,6,C Watson,29th August 2015,"London Heathrow to New Orleans via JFK, LGA, CLT, DFW, on Boeing 777-300ER, A321/319 and Canadair RJ900. I had a code share flight from Geneva with British Airways but I had to change terminal which meant clearing security again - American Airlines has very few European connections at Heathrow so I'd rather transit elsewhere, given the choice. While free wine and beer is a welcome addition in economy class, the food is still lacking in quality and served in little black boxes that give an industrial feel. Integration with US Airways is incomplete; I had a domestic flight segment operated with a US Airways flight number but an aircraft with American Airlines livery on the outside (and US Airways inside) and there was no way to know whether I'd have to pay for my luggage. It ended up costing me $25 from LGA to MSY - no prior warning (and another website that declared the charge would have been cheaper overall). Change of airport required for a connection in New York so I spent a few days there. Generally the cabin crew were pretty friendly and I appreciated the interiors in the new Boeing 777-300ER with individual IFE. On the way home, they would have wanted me to pay $25 to choose any other seat on my flight from MSY to DFW but the back row; $75 to choose anything but a middle seat between DFW and LHR. I thought this was stingy, especially since I checked in early. Also, when I tried to check in online, the AA website sent me to US Airways and then US Airways sent me back to AA. With my BA legs I had 3 different booking codes (I had to find the US Airways one from Check My Trip). Flight out of LGA was late - the captain never came on to explain why it took so long to taxi to the runway - but the crew were great, eg. making people change seats just before landing so that anyone with a tight connection got an aisle seat. Overall I felt that this experience was not bad; better than United but I would always choose a European Airline over American Airlines if I could. A lot of disabled people were helped by the ground crew which was good. While the apps were pretty bad in the sense that check in was hard and so was getting my own boarding pass - it's not possible to download it to the app. I did. however, appreciate the Wifi luggage checking facility - you can scan your baggage tag and see if your bags made it to the plane through the onboard wifi.","Boeing 777-300ER, A321/319",Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to New Orleans,August 2015,3,3,3,3,3,4,no

Rude, unhelpful and petty rule driven check in employees at AA in Quito Airport causing long lines at check in. Old B767 - my standard overhead carry on bag would not fit in the bins.

American Airlines,1,J Vandervelde,26th August 2015,"Scheduled flight to leave on Sunday August 16, 2015 from Sea/Tac at 1:31pm. The plane that we were going to use pulled up to pick us up. Then some ""newly hired flight attendant"" activates the slide - see the photo. Evidently once the slide has been deployed out the side of the plane, you can't just poke it back in and fly away. Also, who would have guessed that there isn't a backup plane available. So now we have to wait until 8pm for another plane to fly from Dallas to pick us up. Does it take 6 hours to fly from Dallas to Seattle? I think not. We are notified that we will miss all our connecting flights. The next seats available to Des Moines aren't until Tuesday or Wednesday. Well that isn't going too well with our employers, so we negotiate through a supervisor with ""finance"" to get reimbursement should we fly to another city and take ground transport home. BTW, we were offered snacks for sale and a movie headphone for sale while we were on our flight with 200 passengers that also sat at the airport all day waiting for this flight. Absolutely rude. Okay so we were up all night flying and arrived in nearby city at 9:30am on Monday so we could drive home 2 more hours. We were sleep deprived but finally home around noon on Monday.

American Airlines,8,Jorgen Aberg,26th August 2015,"The new American Airlines business class on the Boeing 777 is very good with two exceptions. First, catering needs a serious upgrade. The food was barely edible, and I must admit although I like ice cream for dessert, my expectations are a bit higher when travelling business class on a long-haul flight. The so called ""Champagne"" is Prosecco, which is a fine Italian product, but not Champagne by a long shot. I would suggest that American Airlines should either offer the real thing, or call it Prosecco. My second exception has to do with the comfort of the seat.

American Airlines,5,Jose Maurcio Montoya,26th August 2015,"This is an impressive and smooth aircraft and I had waited months to my first AA787 experience. For that reason I flew from NY to Buenos Aires via DFW. I've flown other 787s and this aircraft's first impression is created by the incredible effect of its smart lighting and design. Boarding AA's 787 from DFW to EZE was nothing like it. The cabin was quite dark and it felt very cold and claustrophobic. Overall the crew showed a lack of knowledge of the product and did not know how to help passengers enjoy the excellent experience flying a 787 is in itself. AA's 787 has, in my opinion, very decent and comfortable seats (I slept over 7 hours) and great personal space. But entertainment did not work for a portion of the flight and crew members did not seem to know how to fix it. Service was very slow and very impersonal and it seemed as if it was short of 1 or even 2 crew members. There was nothing memorable about the food, but who flies AA for its culinary virtues? So it was ok. Although I did not pre-order my breakfast before falling sleep, I was fully awake when that service started, yet they skipped me, and I was informed that because I did not tell them a few hours prior that I wanted to eat in the morning, they might not have much left for me (at the end I was served the full meal). I loved being on this aircraft and will look forward to my next flight in it. Too bad AA is missing the opportunity of incorporating decent service to an amazing aircraft in order to deliver the wow factor of other carriers' 787 operation.

American Airlines,1,Veronica McKay,25th August 2015,"This summer my family and I took a vacation to see Europe. We chose an overnight flight so that our children could sleep and the first row so that we could have more room and be comfortable. Needless to say my girls fell asleep and my two year old laid down under our feet on the floor and fell asleep. The seat belt sign was on pretty much the whole flight with no turbulence. My two year old, as mentioned before, was completely out of the way so passing people and airline staff had a clear path way but I was continually harassed instead of helped by staff telling me that policy states she can not be on the floor with the seat belt sign on. Thus, I had to wake up a peacefully sleeping child who then cried and disturbed others. If I could have come up with a better solution I would have but the hand rests on these new planes do not move up in the front row due to there being TV's in them and the seats only go back so far. On the flight back the movie was acting up and instead of going to check to see if it could be fixed they just said that nothing could be done about the bad quality of the movie.

American Airlines,3,Martin Tune,21st August 2015,"Poor overall compared with other flights, particularly the BA one we got from Manchester to Heathrow then to Washington on the way out to the US. The flight was delayed overall by at least an hour, we spent the majority of the delay time sat waiting to set off due to a ""Minor repair"" which was announced by the pilot over the tannoy once we were on board quite some time later. Our delay continued probably due to missing our take off slot, it wasn't clear because no-one really explained what was happening. Within this time period, the cabin crew turned up and suggested we should move to another seat, we'd been settled into our seats for 20-25 minutes and had chosen seats towards the rear of the plane close to the toilets. When we tried to reserve a seat together before flying, it was fairly limited at the time and we were happy enough to be here however the lady suggested they'd be making a lot of noise behind us and would probably be bashing about around the seats as it appeared they'd used up the back row for their stuff and seating, we said this was OK initially but she continued to prompt us to move, we started to do so with us having to start moving and packing up our stuff, there wasn't much in the way of help on offer and we were made to feel like we were causing more of an inconvenience by booking ahead to get our seats, no suggestion of where were going was made initially which resulted in us moving without our stuff and in the end all the confusion and messing about just raised our stress levels. It appeared in the end that some of the cabin crew had taken up the seats around us and thankfully some of the crew, particularly one of the younger female crew members and another gentleman were very courteous and offered help with a clearly very upset passenger, the other more senior staff could do to perhaps follow their lead as their idea of customer service was far below expected. Aside from this, this particular plane had screens above rather than individual ones on the back of the seats, one film was offered, food was OK, same usual fare, I assume from the amount of chatter about drinks I heard that there was a shortage of certain drinks, particularly beer at one point. Generally, I'm disappointed as this is one of the longest and one of the most expensive flights I've been on. I've flown on the more notoriously bad budget airlines and still found that despite all the shortcomings at least the staff seem to care and they also seem to be a bit more apologetic about late flights, I don't think I'd use American Airlines again if there was another choice.",Boeing 767-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to Manchester,August 2015,2,2,3,1,4,2,no

This was extremely frustrating to be strung along for so long. At the very last second, the gate crew made an unintelligible announcement that our flight was being rerouted to LAX. This created chaos and provided only minutes for people to try and make arrangements at their final destinations before boarding and take off. Announcements were difficult to hear and brusquely delivered. On the plane, the crew was perfunctory and unhelpful. The reason for the rerouting was that the San Diego airport would be closed at midnight and we would not make it in time. I am sure the airline staff knew this and could have provided that information in a much more timely fashion than it did.

When at long last I managed to reach the seating plan, the two last remaining economy seats I selected were no more and I was left with having to pay extra for the extra legroom seats. Upon boarding I was appalled by the aged aircraft and obsolete amenities. No individual screens, no plug-ins for phones, not even basic earphones provided unless you pay $5. Both featured movies were 2nd rate and displayed on some heavy CRT suspended units which emitted a very annoying glare during the red-eye flight. The extra legroom was not worthwhile or all that noticeable, as an equally crucial attribute was the lateral tightness of the seats which caused the usual shoulder-rubbing and sleeplessness. It was all-in-all was a strange throw-back to the 70s. For a flight of such duration, there was only one serving of drinks but even then, no snack of any sort. There were no pillows, but some left-over garbage from an earlier flight in the seat pocket. I arrived at baggage claim before others and there was a very long interlude for belt to start moving. Eventually after a prolonged and futile watch, my checked luggage was never forthcoming so I headed to their baggage service to report missing luggage. Luckily agent was helpful and wait wasn't long to write up the delayed baggage claim. However I was perturbed by the sheer number of displaced/delayed baggage affecting over hundred other passengers. An agent finally picked up my call after 35 minutes wait. Their online baggage status still has no update on my luggage where-about. Agent could not give any reason why, despite luggage was being checked over an hour and a half prior to flight departure.",Boeing 757,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Los Angeles,August 2015,1,2,1,1,2,1,no
American Airlines,3,Marcin Ciesielski,15th August 2015,"Service was shocking. The flight from MIA-CUN was delayed due to a thunderstorm which grounded all aircrafts and closed the airport. American Airlines had informed passengers and since there was nothing which could be done, we waited in lounge for boarding to begin. Upon boarding aircraft, the FA's offered drinks and that's where the hospitality ended. After takeoff they came around once more with drinks, and packaged snacks. Afterwards, they stood in the gallery gossiping rather loudly and complaining about the airline (found it rather off putting). On the return leg, similar service. Loud FA's, packaged snacks and less than mediocre service. Older planes on both legs, but they were clean and seats were comfortable. Check-in in CUN was quick and efficient.",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to Cancun,July 2015,2,1,1,,2,1,no
American Airlines,2,Michael Fortin,15th August 2015,"Arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead of my scheduled departure. When I arrived at the ticket counter to check my bag, I was advised my flight had been cancelled at some point late last night or early in the morning due to a flight crew issue. I was placed on a flight that was four hours later than my original flight. All other flights were full so I had to enjoy my six hour visit at the airport. My complaint is for this reason only, other airlines I fly give you email updates when a flight is delayed or cancelled. If American Airlines had taken this approach I could have possibly made another reservation or at least, hung out in my hotel for another four hours. Instead I had to hang out in an airport for six hours.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to DCA,August 2015,2,2,1,,1,2,no
American Airlines,10,P Tyrrell,14th August 2015,"Excellent product. A first class experience. Check in, lounge,inflight service, entertainment and food all top class. Highly recommended.

American Airlines,9,M Evans,13th August 2015,"Flew to Hong Kong via Dallas and back. I had a nice conversation with a flight attendant in the rear of the plane while I couldn't sleep. People don't realize that there are more than one flight attendant available to serve drinks and some snacks during flight, not just during their meal times. American's level of service is very standard for major carriers like Delta and United both domestically and internationally. I find that the majority of the time when I'm traveling it is passengers who do not understand air travel that are most frequently angry or upset. Those of us who travel frequently understand, those that don't have no idea.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HKG to DAY via DFW,May 2015,4,5,4,5,4,4,yes
American Airlines,1,L Ahmad,12th August 2015,"Onboard we were told the aircraft had mechanical problem ant we have to disembark and go to another similar plane on another gate. Everybody boarded to this alternative plane with no air conditioning in the hot August in Texas evening. The destination airport was also changed. After waiting more than 1.5 hrs in the plane we told by the crew that plane is going nowhere, and we will be given hotel vouchers until the flight next morning. Everybody got off the plane. The hotel given to us had no shuttle running. We were told that ever 15 minutes shuttle pass by the hotel. We had to hire a private van to get to the hotel. It was already 12 midnight with my four children and wife with one of the most miserable trips of my life. Our next flight was at 7:30am but no hotel shuttle until 6 AM. We had to pay again to hire a cab to the airport. Will never ever travel again with American Airlines.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to New York,August 2015,1,1,1,1,2,1,no
American Airlines,1,Anthony Gallo,12th August 2015,"American Airlines delayed my flight for 3 hours because they didn't have the ""proper crew with experience to fly from San Jose to Dallas"". I finally get to Dallas and they have canceled my flight to Houston for weather reasons. Other airlines would have delayed the flight as the weather passes.

American Airlines,1,Andrew Jenkins,11th August 2015,"The flight back from Tokyo was awful. My in-flight entertainment was broken, they tried resetting it 3 times but it never worked. No music, movies, TV, games, nothing. Just a green screen the whole flight. The food was disgusting. Drinks and snacks were offered sparsely. I emailed American in regards to my in-flight entertainment being inoperable and received a basic ""sorry, your experience doesn't qualify for any sort of compensation."" The American Way magazine advertised our 777-200 with WiFi however WiFi was not available to us. Overall the worst experience I've had aboard an airplane.",777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,NRT to DFW,August 2015,1,1,1,,1,1,no
American Airlines,8,Claire Breukel,9th August 2015,"I take this flight a few times a year and it is a good experience, however on my last flight the attendant went out of her way finding me a special meal and going over and above with her service.

American Airlines,1,Connie Colbert,7th August 2015,"I actually flew American four different times in one week, and experienced significant delays each trip, resulting in my not reaching my destination until 3 to 4 hours after the time I was originally supposed to arrive. The airline was completely unapologetic about the delays, which caused problems with rental cars and also made the entire travel experience exhausting. I will not fly this airline again. In addition, the airline charges for everything - wifi, baggage, snacks, even additional foot space.",,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Minneapolis via DFW,August 2015,1,3,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,S White,6th August 2015,"A dirty and smelly plane, horrible food, dreadful coffee, and bad American Airlines service. Separated from my partner because the flight was overbooked - buying your tickets 8 months beforehand is apparently not enough. First time and last time ever with American Airlines, I have had a better experience in a low cost Russian Tupolev.",Boeing 757,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to La Paz,August 2015,1,1,1,2,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Kaitlyn Stanford,6th August 2015,"Missed my flight. Been on standby all day. They were letting several American Airlines staff on every standby flight, totally disregarding the customers. Don't ever miss your flight with American Airlines. You will not be compensated or put on first availability standby. You will be at the airport for hours or maybe even days. Zero customer service. They are better about customer service on the phone versus in person at the airport. American Airlines tried to make me check my bag which clearly fits the carry on size and I threw a fit. They didn't make me pay for my bag only because my departure time was coming up.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Dallas,August 2015,2,2,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,Anthony Angus,4th August 2015,"Prior to take off the air hostesses wandered the aisles for what looked to be a general safety check. Not the case it would appear.

Across the aisle passengers had their sun shade down while using their cell phone. This was just within 3 rows.",,Couple Leisure,First Class,Washington DC to Las Vegas,July 2015,3,1,2,,4,3,no
American Airlines,1,Sicilia Vera,4th August 2015,"This was our first time in first class and the experience was horrific! We flew to Montego Bay from Killeen Tx and when we arrived, our luggage did not. It would've been ok if they were courteous and respectful but they were horrible. We arrived at Montego Bay at 3.55pm and didn't get to speak with anyone about our luggage until 6.15 pm because the person who was suppose to be at our counter (AA) was ""busy assisting someone else"" as they kept telling us. When we did speak with someone, they informed me that our luggage was still in Dallas but will arrive first thing in the morning. We were excited to hear that and continued on to our resort. First thing in the morning came and went, afternoon came and went, evening came and went. We had the hotel call the airport (we tried calling ourselves but the room phone wouldn't properly dial out the 800 number) they were told the luggage would be here soon. Our luggage came at 11 pm the second night we were there. Our vacation was only for 6 days, two days have already passed when we received it. No one knows why we didn't get it until and when the resort called they kept lying (AA representative) and said it was already on its way and would be here in two hours. We heard two hours for two days. Fast forward 8 days. We used AA once again for our trip to Aruba which was 8 days after this first disaster. When we go to check in (again first class/business class) the airline double booked us and had us flying to multiple locations. AA rep informed us we would have to check in at counter. We went to check in at the counter and it took us TWO hours, yes two hours to fix our reservations. I am traveling with my SO who is a disabled veteran (we both are veterans) who was told he had to stand those two hours because they didn't have a wheelchair available for him. It takes AA two hours to issue us tickets and then they change our flights making our stay in Aruba airport 4 hours. When I expressed how disappointed we were the AA rep informed me that this is the norm for AA. He said we shouldn't be complaining about only waiting two hours to get our tickets printed. He was rude along with the manager who kept talking in Spanish. We fly often, very often using American Airlines and we are embarrassed for you guys treating customers this way.",,Business,First Class,Killeen to Montego Bay,July 2015,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,3,Tony Pay,3rd August 2015,"My 3.5 hour flight was scheduled to depart at 5am going to Dallas. Ground crew announced the flight was overbooked. Many passengers were on standby which caused some problems. Boarding was chaotic and unorganized but fortunately managed to close the doors on time. The aircraft was their new A321. Cabin was clean, seats are ok with IFE and legroom is spacious. Take off was smooth. To my horror we had to pay in order for us to watch a movie and even use the wifi. For the whole flight nobody served drinks to passengers. A lot of the passengers were complaining. Flight attendants were at the back chatting.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Toronto via Dallas,August 2015,3,1,,,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,Raphaël Garrec,3rd August 2015,"US Airways now merged into American Airlines does not seem to have made much effort into improving service!

American Airlines,1,E Coraci,2nd August 2015,"We were delayed 2.5 hours in the airport. Then when we do board we sit in the airplane for another hour with no updates as to what was going on. Finally the captain tells us the flight crew ""timed out"" and we have to return to the terminal. We waited another 20 minutes to get in to the terminal and were told to go to the help desk to reschedule. We returned to the line containing about 4 separate flights worth of people. They would only put us on AA flights so we were very limited. We received no compensation or food vouchers and were forced to sleep at the airport. The next day we caught our flights and though we were told our baggage would be in Philadelphia to meet us, it was not. We had to wait in another long line to give our information to have it delivered.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Miami to Philadelphia,August 2015,3,1,3,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Tomi Mill,2nd August 2015,Every single one of my flights was either delayed or canceled. It took me over 10 hours past my flight time just to get out of Boston. I was promised another connecting flight since American made me miss my original flight because they didn't have a document giving them flight clearance (it took them over 2 hours just to get a piece of paper that said we could take off faxed over). I get in to Chicago and I'm told that I can't get on the connecting flight (over booked of course). They put me on a plane that leaves 14 hours later. I am refused a hotel voucher even though it was Americans's fault I missed my flight. I had to sleep in a cold airport terminal by myself and wasn't even offered a food voucher or given an apology.,,,,,,,,,,,,
